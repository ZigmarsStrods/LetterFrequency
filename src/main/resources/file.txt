<br/>Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly<br/>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse<br/>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.<br/>’Sblood, but you’ll not hear me!<br/>If ever I did dream of such a matter,<br/>Abhor me.<br/>Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.<br/>Despise me<br/>If I do not. Three great ones of the city,<br/>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br/>Off-capped to him; and, by the faith of man,<br/>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.<br/>But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,<br/>Evades them with a bombast circumstance,<br/>Horribly stuffed with epithets of war,<br/>And in conclusion,<br/>Nonsuits my mediators. For Certes, says he,<br/>I have already chose my officer.<br/>And what was he?<br/>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br/>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br/>A fellow almost damned in a fair wife,<br/>That never set a squadron in the field,<br/>Nor the division of a battle knows<br/>More than a spinster—unless the bookish theoric,<br/>Wherein the togèd consuls can propose<br/>As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice<br/>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th’ election;<br/>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br/>At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds<br/>Christened and heathen, must be beleed and<br/>calmed<br/>By debitor and creditor. This countercaster,<br/>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br/>And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.<br/>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.<br/>Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service.<br/>Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br/>And not by old gradation, where each second<br/>Stood heir to th’ first. Now, sir, be judge yourself<br/>Whether I in any just term am affined<br/>To love the Moor.<br/>I would not follow him, then.<br/>O, sir, content you.<br/>I follow him to serve my turn upon him.<br/>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br/>Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark<br/>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave<br/>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br/>Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,<br/>For naught but provender, and when he’s old,<br/>cashiered.<br/>Whip me such honest knaves! Others there are<br/>Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,<br/>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br/>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br/>Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined<br/>their coats,<br/>Do themselves homage. These fellows have some<br/>soul,<br/>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br/>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br/>Were I the Moor I would not be Iago.<br/>In following him, I follow but myself.<br/>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br/>But seeming so for my peculiar end.<br/>For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br/>The native act and figure of my heart<br/>In complement extern, ’tis not long after<br/>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br/>For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.<br/>What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe<br/>If he can carry ’t thus!<br/>Call up her father.<br/>Rouse him. Make after him, poison his delight,<br/>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br/>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br/>Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,<br/>Yet throw such chances of vexation on ’t<br/>As it may lose some color.<br/>Here is her father’s house. I’ll call aloud.<br/>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell<br/>As when, by night and negligence, the fire<br/>Is spied in populous cities.<br/>What ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!<br/>Awake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!<br/>Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!<br/>Thieves, thieves!<br/>What is the reason of this terrible summons?<br/>What is the matter there?<br/>Signior, is all your family within?<br/>Are your doors locked?<br/>Why, wherefore ask you this?<br/>Zounds, sir, you’re robbed. For shame, put on your<br/>gown!<br/>Your heart is burst. You have lost half your soul.<br/>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<br/>Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!<br/>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<br/>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.<br/>Arise, I say!<br/>What, have you lost your wits?<br/>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?<br/>Not I. What are you?<br/>My name is Roderigo.<br/>The worser welcome.<br/>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.<br/>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say<br/>My daughter is not for thee. And now in madness,<br/>Being full of supper and distemp’ring draughts,<br/>Upon malicious bravery dost thou come<br/>To start my quiet.<br/>Sir, sir, sir—<br/>But thou must needs be sure<br/>My spirit and my place have in them power<br/>To make this bitter to thee.<br/>Patience, good sir.<br/>What tell’st thou me of robbing?<br/>This is Venice. My house is not a grange.<br/>Most grave Brabantio,<br/>In simple and pure soul I come to you—<br/>Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not<br/>serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to<br/>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll<br/>have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse,<br/>you’ll have your nephews neigh to you, you’ll have<br/>coursers for cousins and jennets for germans.<br/>What profane wretch art thou?<br/>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter<br/>and the Moor are now making the beast with<br/>two backs.<br/>Thou art a villain.<br/>You are a senator.<br/>This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.<br/>Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,<br/>If ’t be your pleasure and most wise consent—<br/>As partly I find it is—that your fair daughter,<br/>At this odd-even and dull watch o’ th’ night,<br/>Transported with no worse nor better guard<br/>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<br/>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:<br/>If this be known to you, and your allowance,<br/>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.<br/>But if you know not this, my manners tell me<br/>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<br/>That from the sense of all civility<br/>I thus would play and trifle with your Reverence.<br/>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,<br/>I say again, hath made a gross revolt,<br/>Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes<br/>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br/>Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself.<br/>If she be in her chamber or your house,<br/>Let loose on me the justice of the state<br/>For thus deluding you.<br/>Strike on the tinder, ho!<br/>Give me a taper. Call up all my people.<br/>This accident is not unlike my dream.<br/>Belief of it oppresses me already.<br/>Light, I say, light!<br/>Farewell, for I must leave you.<br/>It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place<br/>To be producted, as if I stay I shall,<br/>Against the Moor. For I do know the state,<br/>However this may gall him with some check,<br/>Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embarked<br/>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<br/>Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,<br/>Another of his fathom they have none<br/>To lead their business. In which regard,<br/>Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,<br/>Yet, for necessity of present life,<br/>I must show out a flag and sign of love—<br/>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find<br/>him,<br/>Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search,<br/>And there will I be with him. So, farewell.<br/>It is too true an evil. Gone she is,<br/>And what’s to come of my despisèd time<br/>Is naught but bitterness.—Now, Roderigo,<br/>Where didst thou see her?—O, unhappy girl!—<br/>With the Moor, sayst thou?—Who would be a<br/>father?—<br/>How didst thou know ’twas she?—O, she deceives<br/>me<br/>Past thought!—What said she to you?—Get more<br/>tapers.<br/>Raise all my kindred.—Are they married, think<br/>you?<br/>Truly, I think they are.<br/>O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!<br/>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds<br/>By what you see them act.—Is there not charms<br/>By which the property of youth and maidhood<br/>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<br/>Of some such thing?<br/>Yes, sir, I have indeed.<br/>Call up my brother.—O, would you had had her!—<br/>Some one way, some another.—Do you know<br/>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?<br/>I think I can discover him, if you please<br/>To get good guard and go along with me.<br/>Pray you lead on. At every house I’ll call.<br/>I may command at most.—Get weapons, ho!<br/>And raise some special officers of night.—<br/>On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.<br/>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,<br/>Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ th’ conscience<br/>To do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity<br/>Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times<br/>I had thought t’ have yerked him here under the<br/>ribs.<br/>’Tis better as it is.<br/>Nay, but he prated<br/>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms<br/>Against your Honor,<br/>That with the little godliness I have<br/>I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,<br/>Are you fast married? Be assured of this,<br/>That the magnifico is much beloved,<br/>And hath in his effect a voice potential<br/>As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you<br/>Or put upon you what restraint or grievance<br/>The law (with all his might to enforce it on)<br/>Will give him cable.<br/>Let him do his spite.<br/>My services which I have done the signiory<br/>Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know<br/>(Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,<br/>I shall promulgate) I fetch my life and being<br/>From men of royal siege, and my demerits<br/>May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune<br/>As this that I have reached. For know, Iago,<br/>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,<br/>I would not my unhousèd free condition<br/>Put into circumscription and confine<br/>For the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come<br/>yond?<br/>Those are the raisèd father and his friends.<br/>You were best go in.<br/>Not I. I must be found.<br/>My parts, my title, and my perfect soul<br/>Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?<br/>By Janus, I think no.<br/>The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant!<br/>The goodness of the night upon you, friends.<br/>What is the news?<br/>The Duke does greet you, general,<br/>And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,<br/>Even on the instant.<br/>What is the matter, think you?<br/>Something from Cyprus, as I may divine.<br/>It is a business of some heat. The galleys<br/>Have sent a dozen sequent messengers<br/>This very night at one another’s heels,<br/>And many of the Consuls, raised and met,<br/>Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly<br/>called for.<br/>When, being not at your lodging to be found,<br/>The Senate hath sent about three several quests<br/>To search you out.<br/>’Tis well I am found by you.<br/>I will but spend a word here in the house<br/>And go with you.<br/>Ancient, what makes he here?<br/>Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.<br/>If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.<br/>I do not understand.<br/>He’s married.<br/>To who?<br/>Marry, to—<br/>Come, captain, will you go?<br/>Have with you.<br/>Here comes another troop to seek for you.<br/>It is Brabantio. General, be advised,<br/>He comes to bad intent.<br/>Holla, stand there!<br/>Signior, it is the Moor.<br/>Down with him,<br/>thief!<br/>You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.<br/>Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust<br/>them.<br/>Good signior, you shall more command with years<br/>Than with your weapons.<br/>O, thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my<br/>daughter?<br/>Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!<br/>For I’ll refer me to all things of sense,<br/>If she in chains of magic were not bound,<br/>Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,<br/>So opposite to marriage that she shunned<br/>The wealthy curlèd darlings of our nation,<br/>Would ever have, t’ incur a general mock,<br/>Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom<br/>Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight!<br/>Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense<br/>That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,<br/>Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<br/>That weakens motion. I’ll have ’t disputed on.<br/>’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.<br/>I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<br/>For an abuser of the world, a practicer<br/>Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.—<br/>Lay hold upon him. If he do resist,<br/>Subdue him at his peril.<br/>Hold your hands,<br/>Both you of my inclining and the rest.<br/>Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it<br/>Without a prompter.—Whither will you that I go<br/>To answer this your charge?<br/>To prison, till fit time<br/>Of law and course of direct session<br/>Call thee to answer.<br/>What if I do obey?<br/>How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,<br/>Whose messengers are here about my side,<br/>Upon some present business of the state,<br/>To bring me to him?<br/>’Tis true, most worthy signior.<br/>The Duke’s in council, and your noble self<br/>I am sure is sent for.<br/>How? The Duke in council?<br/>In this time of the night? Bring him away;<br/>Mine’s not an idle cause. The Duke himself,<br/>Or any of my brothers of the state,<br/>Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.<br/>For if such actions may have passage free,<br/>Bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.<br/>There’s no composition in these news<br/>That gives them credit.<br/>Indeed, they are disproportioned.<br/>My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.<br/>And mine, a hundred forty.<br/>And mine, two hundred.<br/>But though they jump not on a just account<br/>(As in these cases, where the aim reports<br/>’Tis oft with difference), yet do they all confirm<br/>A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.<br/>Nay, it is possible enough to judgment.<br/>I do not so secure me in the error,<br/>But the main article I do approve<br/>In fearful sense.<br/>What ho, what ho, what ho!<br/>A messenger from the galleys.<br/>Now, what’s the business?<br/>The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes.<br/>So was I bid report here to the state<br/>By Signior Angelo.<br/>How say you by this change?<br/>This cannot be,<br/>By no assay of reason. ’Tis a pageant<br/>To keep us in false gaze. When we consider<br/>Th’ importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,<br/>And let ourselves again but understand<br/>That, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,<br/>So may he with more facile question bear it,<br/>For that it stands not in such warlike brace,<br/>But altogether lacks th’ abilities<br/>That Rhodes is dressed in—if we make thought of<br/>this,<br/>We must not think the Turk is so unskillful<br/>To leave that latest which concerns him first,<br/>Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain<br/>To wake and wage a danger profitless.<br/>Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.<br/>Here is more news.<br/>The Ottomites, Reverend and Gracious,<br/>Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,<br/>Have there injointed them with an after fleet.<br/>Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?<br/>Of thirty sail; and now they do restem<br/>Their backward course, bearing with frank<br/>appearance<br/>Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,<br/>Your trusty and most valiant servitor,<br/>With his free duty recommends you thus,<br/>And prays you to believe him.<br/>’Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.<br/>Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?<br/>He’s now in Florence.<br/>Write from us to him.<br/>Post-post-haste. Dispatch.<br/>Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.<br/>Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you<br/>Against the general enemy Ottoman.<br/>I did not see you. Welcome, gentle<br/>signior.<br/>We lacked your counsel and your help tonight.<br/>So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me.<br/>Neither my place nor aught I heard of business<br/>Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general<br/>care<br/>Take hold on me, for my particular grief<br/>Is of so floodgate and o’erbearing nature<br/>That it engluts and swallows other sorrows<br/>And it is still itself.<br/>Why, what’s the matter?<br/>My daughter! O, my daughter!<br/>Dead?<br/>Ay, to me.<br/>She is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted<br/>By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;<br/>For nature so prepost’rously to err—<br/>Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense—<br/>Sans witchcraft could not.<br/>Whoe’er he be that in this foul proceeding<br/>Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself<br/>And you of her, the bloody book of law<br/>You shall yourself read in the bitter letter,<br/>After your own sense, yea, though our proper son<br/>Stood in your action.<br/>Humbly I thank your Grace.<br/>Here is the man—this Moor, whom now it seems<br/>Your special mandate for the state affairs<br/>Hath hither brought.<br/>We are very sorry for ’t.<br/>What, in your own part, can you say to this?<br/>Nothing, but this is so.<br/>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,<br/>My very noble and approved good masters:<br/>That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,<br/>It is most true; true I have married her.<br/>The very head and front of my offending<br/>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,<br/>And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace;<br/>For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,<br/>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used<br/>Their dearest action in the tented field,<br/>And little of this great world can I speak<br/>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle.<br/>And therefore little shall I grace my cause<br/>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious<br/>patience,<br/>I will a round unvarnished tale deliver<br/>Of my whole course of love—what drugs, what<br/>charms,<br/>What conjuration, and what mighty magic<br/>(For such proceeding I am charged withal)<br/>I won his daughter.<br/>A maiden never bold,<br/>Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion<br/>Blushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature,<br/>Of years, of country, credit, everything,<br/>To fall in love with what she feared to look on!<br/>It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect<br/>That will confess perfection so could err<br/>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven<br/>To find out practices of cunning hell<br/>Why this should be. I therefore vouch again<br/>That with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,<br/>Or with some dram conjured to this effect,<br/>He wrought upon her.<br/>To vouch this is no proof<br/>Without more wider and more overt test<br/>Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods<br/>Of modern seeming do prefer against him.<br/>But, Othello, speak:<br/>Did you by indirect and forcèd courses<br/>Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections?<br/>Or came it by request, and such fair question<br/>As soul to soul affordeth?<br/>I do beseech you,<br/>Send for the lady to the Sagittary<br/>And let her speak of me before her father.<br/>If you do find me foul in her report,<br/>The trust, the office I do hold of you,<br/>Not only take away, but let your sentence<br/>Even fall upon my life.<br/>Fetch Desdemona hither.<br/>Ancient, conduct them. You best know the place.<br/>And till she come, as truly as to heaven<br/>I do confess the vices of my blood,<br/>So justly to your grave ears I’ll present<br/>How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,<br/>And she in mine.<br/>Say it, Othello.<br/>Her father loved me, oft invited me,<br/>Still questioned me the story of my life<br/>From year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes<br/>That I have passed.<br/>I ran it through, even from my boyish days<br/>To th’ very moment that he bade me tell it,<br/>Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:<br/>Of moving accidents by flood and field,<br/>Of hairbreadth ’scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly<br/>breach,<br/>Of being taken by the insolent foe<br/>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,<br/>And portance in my traveler’s history,<br/>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br/>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads<br/>touch heaven,<br/>It was my hint to speak—such was my process—<br/>And of the cannibals that each other eat,<br/>The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads<br/>Do grow beneath their shoulders. These things to<br/>hear<br/>Would Desdemona seriously incline.<br/>But still the house affairs would draw her thence,<br/>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch<br/>She’d come again, and with a greedy ear<br/>Devour up my discourse. Which I, observing,<br/>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br/>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br/>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br/>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br/>But not intentively. I did consent,<br/>And often did beguile her of her tears<br/>When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br/>That my youth suffered. My story being done,<br/>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.<br/>She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing<br/>strange,<br/>’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.<br/>She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished<br/>That heaven had made her such a man. She thanked<br/>me,<br/>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,<br/>I should but teach him how to tell my story,<br/>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.<br/>She loved me for the dangers I had passed,<br/>And I loved her that she did pity them.<br/>This only is the witchcraft I have used.<br/>Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.<br/>I think this tale would win my daughter, too.<br/>Good Brabantio,<br/>Take up this mangled matter at the best.<br/>Men do their broken weapons rather use<br/>Than their bare hands.<br/>I pray you hear her speak.<br/>If she confess that she was half the wooer,<br/>Destruction on my head if my bad blame<br/>Light on the man.—Come hither, gentle mistress.<br/>Do you perceive in all this noble company<br/>Where most you owe obedience?<br/>My noble father,<br/>I do perceive here a divided duty.<br/>To you I am bound for life and education.<br/>My life and education both do learn me<br/>How to respect you. You are the lord of duty.<br/>I am hitherto your daughter. But here’s my<br/>husband.<br/>And so much duty as my mother showed<br/>To you, preferring you before her father,<br/>So much I challenge that I may profess<br/>Due to the Moor my lord.<br/>God be with you! I have done.<br/>Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs.<br/>I had rather to adopt a child than get it.—<br/>Come hither, Moor.<br/>I here do give thee that with all my heart<br/>Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart<br/>I would keep from thee.—For your sake, jewel,<br/>I am glad at soul I have no other child,<br/>For thy escape would teach me tyranny,<br/>To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.<br/>Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,<br/>Which as a grise or step may help these lovers<br/>Into your favor.<br/>When remedies are past, the griefs are ended<br/>By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.<br/>To mourn a mischief that is past and gone<br/>Is the next way to draw new mischief on.<br/>What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,<br/>Patience her injury a mock’ry makes.<br/>The robbed that smiles steals something from the<br/>thief;<br/>He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.<br/>So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,<br/>We lose it not so long as we can smile.<br/>He bears the sentence well that nothing bears<br/>But the free comfort which from thence he hears;<br/>But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow<br/>That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.<br/>These sentences to sugar or to gall,<br/>Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.<br/>But words are words. I never yet did hear<br/>That the bruised heart was piercèd through the<br/>ear.<br/>I humbly beseech you, proceed to th’ affairs of<br/>state.<br/>The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes<br/>for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is<br/>best known to you. And though we have there a<br/>substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a<br/>sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer<br/>voice on you. You must therefore be content to<br/>slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this<br/>more stubborn and boist’rous expedition.<br/>The tyrant custom, most grave senators,<br/>Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war<br/>My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize<br/>A natural and prompt alacrity<br/>I find in hardness, and do undertake<br/>This present wars against the Ottomites.<br/>Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state,<br/>I crave fit disposition for my wife,<br/>Due reference of place and exhibition,<br/>With such accommodation and besort<br/>As levels with her breeding.<br/>Why, at her father’s.<br/>I will not have it so.<br/>Nor I.<br/>Nor would I there reside<br/>To put my father in impatient thoughts<br/>By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,<br/>To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear<br/>And let me find a charter in your voice<br/>T’ assist my simpleness.<br/>What would you, Desdemona?<br/>That I love the Moor to live with him<br/>My downright violence and storm of fortunes<br/>May trumpet to the world. My heart’s subdued<br/>Even to the very quality of my lord.<br/>I saw Othello’s visage in his mind,<br/>And to his honors and his valiant parts<br/>Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.<br/>So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,<br/>A moth of peace, and he go to the war,<br/>The rites for why I love him are bereft me<br/>And I a heavy interim shall support<br/>By his dear absence. Let me go with him.<br/>Let her have your voice.<br/>Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not<br/>To please the palate of my appetite,<br/>Nor to comply with heat (the young affects<br/>In me defunct) and proper satisfaction,<br/>But to be free and bounteous to her mind.<br/>And heaven defend your good souls that you think<br/>I will your serious and great business scant<br/>For she is with me. No, when light-winged toys<br/>Of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness<br/>My speculative and officed instruments,<br/>That my disports corrupt and taint my business,<br/>Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,<br/>And all indign and base adversities<br/>Make head against my estimation.<br/>Be it as you shall privately determine,<br/>Either for her stay or going. Th’ affair cries haste,<br/>And speed must answer it.<br/>You must away tonight.<br/>With all my<br/>heart.<br/>At nine i’ th’ morning here we’ll meet again.<br/>Othello, leave some officer behind<br/>And he shall our commission bring to you,<br/>With such things else of quality and respect<br/>As doth import you.<br/>So please your Grace, my<br/>ancient.<br/>A man he is of honesty and trust.<br/>To his conveyance I assign my wife,<br/>With what else needful your good Grace shall think<br/>To be sent after me.<br/>Let it be so.<br/>Good night to everyone. And, noble<br/>signior,<br/>If virtue no delighted beauty lack,<br/>Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.<br/>Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.<br/>Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.<br/>She has deceived her father, and may thee.<br/>My life upon her faith!<br/>Honest Iago,<br/>My Desdemona must I leave to thee.<br/>I prithee let thy wife attend on her,<br/>And bring them after in the best advantage.—<br/>Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour<br/>Of love, of worldly matters, and direction<br/>To spend with thee. We must obey the time.<br/>Iago—<br/>What sayst thou, noble heart?<br/>What will I do, think’st thou?<br/>Why, go to bed and sleep.<br/>I will incontinently drown myself.<br/>If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,<br/>thou silly gentleman!<br/>It is silliness to live, when to live is torment,<br/>and then have we a prescription to die when death is<br/>our physician.<br/>O, villainous! I have looked upon the world for<br/>four times seven years, and since I could distinguish<br/>betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found<br/>man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say<br/>I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I<br/>would change my humanity with a baboon.<br/>What should I do? I confess it is my shame<br/>to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.<br/>Virtue? A fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or<br/>thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our<br/>wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles<br/>or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme,<br/>supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it<br/>with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or<br/>manured with industry, why the power and corrigible<br/>authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance<br/>of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise<br/>another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our<br/>natures would conduct us to most prepost’rous<br/>conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging<br/>motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts—<br/>whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect, or<br/>scion.<br/>It cannot be.<br/>It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission<br/>of the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown<br/>cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy<br/>friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving<br/>with cables of perdurable toughness. I could never<br/>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse.<br/>Follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an<br/>usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It<br/>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue<br/>her love to the Moor—put money in thy purse—<br/>nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in<br/>her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration<br/>—put but money in thy purse. These Moors are<br/>changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money.<br/>The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts<br/>shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.<br/>She must change for youth. When she is sated<br/>with his body she will find the error of her choice.<br/>Therefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt<br/>needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than<br/>drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony<br/>and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian<br/>and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my<br/>wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her.<br/>Therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself!<br/>It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be<br/>hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned<br/>and go without her.<br/>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on<br/>the issue?<br/>Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have<br/>told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I<br/>hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no<br/>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge<br/>against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost<br/>thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many<br/>events in the womb of time which will be delivered.<br/>Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more<br/>of this tomorrow. Adieu.<br/>Where shall we meet i’ th’ morning?<br/>At my lodging.<br/>I’ll be with thee betimes.<br/>Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?<br/>What say you?<br/>No more of drowning, do you hear?<br/>I am changed.<br/>Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your<br/>purse.<br/>I’ll sell all my land.<br/>Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.<br/>For I mine own gained knowledge should profane<br/>If I would time expend with such a snipe<br/>But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,<br/>And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets<br/>’Has done my office. I know not if ’t be true,<br/>But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,<br/>Will do as if for surety. He holds me well.<br/>The better shall my purpose work on him.<br/>Cassio’s a proper man. Let me see now:<br/>To get his place and to plume up my will<br/>In double knavery—How? how?—Let’s see.<br/>After some time, to abuse Othello’s ear<br/>That he is too familiar with his wife.<br/>He hath a person and a smooth dispose<br/>To be suspected, framed to make women false.<br/>The Moor is of a free and open nature<br/>That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,<br/>And will as tenderly be led by th’ nose<br/>As asses are.<br/>I have ’t. It is engendered. Hell and night<br/>Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.<br/>What from the cape can you discern at sea?<br/>Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood.<br/>I cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main<br/>Descry a sail.<br/>Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.<br/>A fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements.<br/>If it hath ruffianed so upon the sea,<br/>What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,<br/>Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?<br/>A segregation of the Turkish fleet.<br/>For do but stand upon the foaming shore,<br/>The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,<br/>The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous<br/>mane,<br/>Seems to cast water on the burning Bear<br/>And quench the guards of th’ ever-fixèd pole.<br/>I never did like molestation view<br/>On the enchafèd flood.<br/>If that the Turkish fleet<br/>Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.<br/>It is impossible to bear it out.<br/>News, lads! Our wars are done.<br/>The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks<br/>That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice<br/>Hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance<br/>On most part of their fleet.<br/>How? Is this true?<br/>The ship is here put in,<br/>A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,<br/>Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,<br/>Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,<br/>And is in full commission here for Cyprus.<br/>I am glad on ’t. ’Tis a worthy governor.<br/>But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort<br/>Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly<br/>And prays the Moor be safe, for they were parted<br/>With foul and violent tempest.<br/>Pray heaven he be;<br/>For I have served him, and the man commands<br/>Like a full soldier. Let’s to the seaside, ho!<br/>As well to see the vessel that’s come in<br/>As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,<br/>Even till we make the main and th’ aerial blue<br/>An indistinct regard.<br/>Come, let’s do so;<br/>For every minute is expectancy<br/>Of more arrivance.<br/>Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,<br/>That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens<br/>Give him defense against the elements,<br/>For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.<br/>Is he well shipped?<br/>His bark is stoutly timbered, and his pilot<br/>Of very expert and approved allowance;<br/>Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,<br/>Stand in bold cure.<br/>What noise?<br/>The town is empty; on the brow o’ th’ sea<br/>Stand ranks of people, and they cry A sail!<br/>My hopes do shape him for the Governor.<br/>They do discharge their shot of courtesy.<br/>Our friends, at least.<br/>I pray you, sir, go forth,<br/>And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived.<br/>I shall.<br/>But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?<br/>Most fortunately. He hath achieved a maid<br/>That paragons description and wild fame,<br/>One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,<br/>And in th’ essential vesture of creation<br/>Does tire the ingener.<br/>How now? Who has put in?<br/>’Tis one Iago, ancient to the General.<br/>’Has had most favorable and happy speed!<br/>Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,<br/>The guttered rocks and congregated sands<br/>(Traitors ensteeped to clog the guiltless keel),<br/>As having sense of beauty, do omit<br/>Their mortal natures, letting go safely by<br/>The divine Desdemona.<br/>What is she?<br/>She that I spake of, our great captain’s captain,<br/>Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,<br/>Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts<br/>A sennight’s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,<br/>And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,<br/>That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,<br/>Make love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms,<br/>Give renewed fire to our extincted spirits,<br/>And bring all Cyprus comfort!<br/>O, behold,<br/>The riches of the ship is come on shore!<br/>You men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.<br/>Hail to thee, lady, and the grace of heaven,<br/>Before, behind thee, and on every hand<br/>Enwheel thee round.<br/>I thank you, valiant Cassio.<br/>What tidings can you tell of my lord?<br/>He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught<br/>But that he’s well and will be shortly here.<br/>O, but I fear—How lost you company?<br/>The great contention of sea and skies<br/>Parted our fellowship.<br/>But hark, a sail!<br/>They give their greeting to the citadel.<br/>This likewise is a friend.<br/>See for the news.<br/>Good ancient, you are welcome. Welcome, mistress.<br/>Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,<br/>That I extend my manners. ’Tis my breeding<br/>That gives me this bold show of courtesy.<br/>Sir, would she give you so much of her lips<br/>As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,<br/>You would have enough.<br/>Alas, she has no speech!<br/>In faith, too much.<br/>I find it still when I have list to sleep.<br/>Marry, before your Ladyship, I grant,<br/>She puts her tongue a little in her heart<br/>And chides with thinking.<br/>You have little cause to say so.<br/>Come on, come on! You are pictures out of door,<br/>bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,<br/>saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players<br/>in your huswifery, and huswives in your beds.<br/>Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer.<br/>Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.<br/>You rise to play, and go to bed to work.<br/>You shall not write my praise.<br/>No, let me not.<br/>What wouldst write of me if thou shouldst praise<br/>me?<br/>O, gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,<br/>For I am nothing if not critical.<br/>Come on, assay.—There’s one gone to the harbor?<br/>Ay, madam.<br/>I am not merry, but I do beguile<br/>The thing I am by seeming otherwise.—<br/>Come, how wouldst thou praise me?<br/>I am about it, but indeed my invention comes<br/>from my pate as birdlime does from frieze: it<br/>plucks out brains and all. But my muse labors, and<br/>thus she is delivered:<br/>If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,<br/>The one’s for use, the other useth it.<br/>Well praised! How if she be black and witty?<br/>If she be black, and thereto have a wit,<br/>She’ll find a white that shall her blackness hit.<br/>Worse and worse.<br/>How if fair and foolish?<br/>She never yet was foolish that was fair,<br/>For even her folly helped her to an heir.<br/>These are old fond paradoxes to make<br/>fools laugh i’ th’ alehouse. What miserable praise<br/>hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish?<br/>There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,<br/>But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.<br/>O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the<br/>worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on<br/>a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority<br/>of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very<br/>malice itself?<br/>She that was ever fair and never proud,<br/>Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,<br/>Never lacked gold and yet went never gay,<br/>Fled from her wish, and yet said Now I may,<br/>She that being angered, her revenge being nigh,<br/>Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,<br/>She that in wisdom never was so frail<br/>To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail,<br/>She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,<br/>See suitors following and not look behind,<br/>She was a wight, if ever such wight were—<br/>To do what?<br/>To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.<br/>O, most lame and impotent conclusion!<br/>—Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy<br/>husband.—How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most<br/>profane and liberal counselor?<br/>He speaks home, madam. You may relish him<br/>more in the soldier than in the scholar.<br/>He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said,<br/>whisper. With as little a web as this will I ensnare as<br/>great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do. I will<br/>gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, ’tis<br/>so indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of<br/>your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not<br/>kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again<br/>you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well<br/>kissed; an excellent courtesy! ’Tis so, indeed. Yet<br/>again your fingers to your lips? Would they were<br/>clyster pipes for your sake!<br/>The Moor. I know his trumpet.<br/>’Tis truly so.<br/>Let’s meet him and receive him.<br/>Lo, where he comes!<br/>O, my fair warrior!<br/>My dear Othello!<br/>It gives me wonder great as my content<br/>To see you here before me. O my soul’s joy!<br/>If after every tempest come such calms,<br/>May the winds blow till they have wakened death,<br/>And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas<br/>Olympus high, and duck again as low<br/>As hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die,<br/>’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear<br/>My soul hath her content so absolute<br/>That not another comfort like to this<br/>Succeeds in unknown fate.<br/>The heavens forbid<br/>But that our loves and comforts should increase<br/>Even as our days do grow!<br/>Amen to that, sweet powers!<br/>I cannot speak enough of this content.<br/>It stops me here; it is too much of joy.<br/>And this, and this, the greatest discords be<br/>That e’er our hearts shall make!<br/>O, you are well tuned now,<br/>But I’ll set down the pegs that make this music,<br/>As honest as I am.<br/>Come. Let us to the castle.—<br/>News, friends! Our wars are done. The Turks are<br/>drowned.<br/>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?—<br/>Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus.<br/>I have found great love amongst them. O, my sweet,<br/>I prattle out of fashion, and I dote<br/>In mine own comforts.—I prithee, good Iago,<br/>Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.<br/>Bring thou the master to the citadel.<br/>He is a good one, and his worthiness<br/>Does challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona.<br/>Once more, well met at Cyprus.<br/>Do thou meet me presently<br/>at the harbor. Come hither. If<br/>thou be’st valiant—as they say base men being in<br/>love have then a nobility in their natures more than<br/>is native to them—list me. The Lieutenant tonight<br/>watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee<br/>this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.<br/>With him? Why, ’tis not possible.<br/>Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.<br/>Mark me with what violence she first loved the<br/>Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical<br/>lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not<br/>thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And<br/>what delight shall she have to look on the devil?<br/>When the blood is made dull with the act of sport,<br/>there should be, again to inflame it and to give<br/>satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy<br/>in years, manners, and beauties, all which the Moor<br/>is defective in. Now, for want of these required<br/>conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself<br/>abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and<br/>abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it<br/>and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir,<br/>this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced<br/>position—who stands so eminent in the degree of<br/>this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no<br/>further conscionable than in putting on the mere<br/>form of civil and humane seeming for the better<br/>compassing of his salt and most hidden loose<br/>affection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and<br/>subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an<br/>eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though<br/>true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave!<br/>Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all<br/>those requisites in him that folly and green minds<br/>look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the<br/>woman hath found him already.<br/>I cannot believe that in her. She’s full of<br/>most blessed condition.<br/>Blessed fig’s end! The wine she drinks is made of<br/>grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never<br/>have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou<br/>not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst<br/>not mark that?<br/>Yes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.<br/>Lechery, by this hand! An index and obscure<br/>prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts.<br/>They met so near with their lips that their breaths<br/>embraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!<br/>When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard<br/>at hand comes the master and main exercise, th’<br/>incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled<br/>by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you<br/>tonight. For the command, I’ll lay ’t upon you.<br/>Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do<br/>you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by<br/>speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from<br/>what other course you please, which the time shall<br/>more favorably minister.<br/>Well.<br/>Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and<br/>haply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may,<br/>for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to<br/>mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no<br/>true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So<br/>shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by<br/>the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the<br/>impediment most profitably removed, without the<br/>which there were no expectation of our prosperity.<br/>I will do this, if you can bring it to any<br/>opportunity.<br/>I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I<br/>must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.<br/>Adieu.<br/>That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t.<br/>That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit.<br/>The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<br/>Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,<br/>And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona<br/>A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,<br/>Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure<br/>I stand accountant for as great a sin)<br/>But partly led to diet my revenge<br/>For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<br/>Hath leaped into my seat—the thought whereof<br/>Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,<br/>And nothing can or shall content my soul<br/>Till I am evened with him, wife for wife,<br/>Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor<br/>At least into a jealousy so strong<br/>That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br/>If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace<br/>For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,<br/>I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br/>Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb<br/>(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),<br/>Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me<br/>For making him egregiously an ass<br/>And practicing upon his peace and quiet<br/>Even to madness. ’Tis here, but yet confused.<br/>Knavery’s plain face is never seen till used.<br/>It is Othello’s pleasure, our noble and valiant<br/>general, that upon certain tidings now arrived,<br/>importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,<br/>every man put himself into triumph: some to<br/>dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what<br/>sport and revels his addition leads him. For besides<br/>these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his<br/>nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed<br/>All offices are open, and there is full<br/>liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till<br/>the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of<br/>Cyprus and our noble general, Othello!<br/>Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.<br/>Let’s teach ourselves that honorable stop<br/>Not to outsport discretion.<br/>Iago hath direction what to do,<br/>But notwithstanding, with my personal eye<br/>Will I look to ’t.<br/>Iago is most honest.<br/>Michael, goodnight. Tomorrow with your earliest<br/>Let me have speech with you. Come,<br/>my dear love,<br/>The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;<br/>That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.—<br/>Goodnight.<br/>Welcome, Iago. We must to the watch.<br/>Not this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’<br/>clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of<br/>his Desdemona—who let us not therefore blame;<br/>he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and<br/>she is sport for Jove.<br/>She’s a most exquisite lady.<br/>And, I’ll warrant her, full of game.<br/>Indeed, she’s a most fresh and delicate<br/>creature.<br/>What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley<br/>to provocation.<br/>An inviting eye, and yet methinks right<br/>modest.<br/>And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?<br/>She is indeed perfection.<br/>Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,<br/>I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a<br/>brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a<br/>measure to the health of black Othello.<br/>Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and<br/>unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish<br/>courtesy would invent some other custom of<br/>entertainment.<br/>O, they are our friends! But one cup; I’ll drink<br/>for you.<br/>I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was<br/>craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it<br/>makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and<br/>dare not task my weakness with any more.<br/>What, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants<br/>desire it.<br/>Where are they?<br/>Here at the door. I pray you, call them in.<br/>I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.<br/>If I can fasten but one cup upon him<br/>With that which he hath drunk tonight already,<br/>He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense<br/>As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool<br/>Roderigo,<br/>Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,<br/>To Desdemona hath tonight caroused<br/>Potations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch.<br/>Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits<br/>That hold their honors in a wary distance,<br/>The very elements of this warlike isle,<br/>Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups;<br/>And they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of<br/>drunkards<br/>Am I to put our Cassio in some action<br/>That may offend the isle. But here they come.<br/>If consequence do but approve my dream,<br/>My boat sails freely both with wind and stream.<br/>’Fore God, they have given me a rouse<br/>already.<br/>Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I<br/>am a soldier.<br/>Some wine, ho!<br/>And let me the cannikin clink, clink,<br/>And let me the cannikin clink.<br/>A soldier’s a man,<br/>O, man’s life’s but a span,<br/>Why, then, let a soldier drink.<br/>Some wine, boys!<br/>’Fore God, an excellent song.<br/>I learned it in England, where indeed they are<br/>most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German,<br/>and your swag-bellied Hollander—drink, ho!—are<br/>nothing to your English.<br/>Is your Englishman so exquisite in his<br/>drinking?<br/>Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane<br/>dead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.<br/>He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next<br/>pottle can be filled.<br/>To the health of our general!<br/>I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you<br/>justice.<br/>O sweet England!<br/>King Stephen was and-a worthy peer,<br/>His breeches cost him but a crown;<br/>He held them sixpence all too dear;<br/>With that he called the tailor lown.<br/>He was a wight of high renown,<br/>And thou art but of low degree;<br/>’Tis pride that pulls the country down,<br/>Then take thy auld cloak about thee.<br/>Some wine, ho!<br/>’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than<br/>the other!<br/>Will you hear ’t again?<br/>No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place<br/>that does those things. Well, God’s above all; and<br/>there be souls must be saved, and there be souls<br/>must not be saved.<br/>It’s true, good lieutenant.<br/>For mine own part—no offense to the General,<br/>nor any man of quality—I hope to be saved.<br/>And so do I too, lieutenant.<br/>Ay, but, by your leave, not before me. The<br/>Lieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient. Let’s<br/>have no more of this. Let’s to our affairs. God<br/>forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our<br/>business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This<br/>is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my<br/>left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough,<br/>and I speak well enough.<br/>Excellent well.<br/>Why, very well then. You must not think then<br/>that I am drunk.<br/>To th’ platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch.<br/>You see this fellow that is gone before?<br/>He’s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar<br/>And give direction; and do but see his vice.<br/>’Tis to his virtue a just equinox,<br/>The one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him.<br/>I fear the trust Othello puts him in,<br/>On some odd time of his infirmity,<br/>Will shake this island.<br/>But is he often thus?<br/>’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.<br/>He’ll watch the horologe a double set<br/>If drink rock not his cradle.<br/>It were well<br/>The General were put in mind of it.<br/>Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature<br/>Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio<br/>And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?<br/>How now, Roderigo?<br/>I pray you, after the Lieutenant, go.<br/>And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor<br/>Should hazard such a place as his own second<br/>With one of an engraffed infirmity.<br/>It were an honest action to say so<br/>To the Moor.<br/>Not I, for this fair island.<br/>I do love Cassio well and would do much<br/>To cure him of this evil—<br/>But hark! What noise?<br/>Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!<br/>What’s the matter, lieutenant?<br/>A knave teach me my duty? I’ll beat the knave<br/>into a twiggen bottle.<br/>Beat me?<br/>Dost thou prate, rogue?<br/>Nay, good lieutenant. I pray you, sir, hold<br/>your hand.<br/>Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o’er the<br/>mazard.<br/>Come, come, you’re drunk.<br/>Drunk?<br/>Away, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.<br/>Nay, good lieutenant.—God’s will, gentlemen!—<br/>Help, ho! Lieutenant—sir—Montano—sir—<br/>Help, masters!—Here’s a goodly watch indeed!<br/>Who’s that which rings the bell? Diablo, ho!<br/>The town will rise. God’s will, lieutenant, hold!<br/>You will be shamed forever.<br/>What is the matter here?<br/>Zounds, I bleed<br/>still.<br/>I am hurt to th’ death. He dies!<br/>Hold, for your lives!<br/>Hold, ho! Lieutenant—sir—Montano—<br/>gentlemen—<br/>Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?<br/>Hold! The General speaks to you. Hold, for shame!<br/>Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?<br/>Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that<br/>Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?<br/>For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!<br/>He that stirs next to carve for his own rage<br/>Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.<br/>Silence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle<br/>From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?<br/>Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,<br/>Speak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.<br/>I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,<br/>In quarter and in terms like bride and groom<br/>Divesting them for bed; and then but now,<br/>As if some planet had unwitted men,<br/>Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,<br/>In opposition bloody. I cannot speak<br/>Any beginning to this peevish odds,<br/>And would in action glorious I had lost<br/>Those legs that brought me to a part of it!<br/>How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?<br/>I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.<br/>Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.<br/>The gravity and stillness of your youth<br/>The world hath noted. And your name is great<br/>In mouths of wisest censure. What’s the matter<br/>That you unlace your reputation thus,<br/>And spend your rich opinion for the name<br/>Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.<br/>Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.<br/>Your officer Iago can inform you,<br/>While I spare speech, which something now offends<br/>me,<br/>Of all that I do know; nor know I aught<br/>By me that’s said or done amiss this night,<br/>Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,<br/>And to defend ourselves it be a sin<br/>When violence assails us.<br/>Now, by heaven,<br/>My blood begins my safer guides to rule,<br/>And passion, having my best judgment collied,<br/>Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,<br/>Or do but lift this arm, the best of you<br/>Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know<br/>How this foul rout began, who set it on;<br/>And he that is approved in this offense,<br/>Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth,<br/>Shall lose me. What, in a town of war<br/>Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,<br/>To manage private and domestic quarrel,<br/>In night, and on the court and guard of safety?<br/>’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began ’t?<br/>If partially affined, or leagued in office,<br/>Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,<br/>Thou art no soldier.<br/>Touch me not so near.<br/>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth<br/>Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio.<br/>Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth<br/>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:<br/>Montano and myself being in speech,<br/>There comes a fellow crying out for help,<br/>And Cassio following him with determined sword<br/>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman<br/>Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.<br/>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,<br/>Lest by his clamor—as it so fell out—<br/>The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,<br/>Outran my purpose, and I returned the rather<br/>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords<br/>And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight<br/>I ne’er might say before. When I came back—<br/>For this was brief—I found them close together<br/>At blow and thrust, even as again they were<br/>When you yourself did part them.<br/>More of this matter cannot I report.<br/>But men are men; the best sometimes forget.<br/>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<br/>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<br/>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received<br/>From him that fled some strange indignity<br/>Which patience could not pass.<br/>I know, Iago,<br/>Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,<br/>Making it light to Cassio.—Cassio, I love thee,<br/>But nevermore be officer of mine.<br/>Look if my gentle love be not raised up!<br/>I’ll make thee an example.<br/>What is the matter, dear?<br/>All’s well now,<br/>sweeting.<br/>Come away to bed. Sir, for your hurts,<br/>Myself will be your surgeon.—Lead him off.<br/>Iago, look with care about the town<br/>And silence those whom this vile brawl<br/>distracted.—<br/>Come, Desdemona. ’Tis the soldier’s life<br/>To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.<br/>What, are you hurt, lieutenant?<br/>Ay, past all surgery.<br/>Marry, God forbid!<br/>Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have<br/>lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of<br/>myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,<br/>Iago, my reputation!<br/>As I am an honest man, I thought you had<br/>received some bodily wound. There is more sense<br/>in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and<br/>most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost<br/>without deserving. You have lost no reputation at<br/>all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What,<br/>man, there are ways to recover the General again!<br/>You are but now cast in his mood—a punishment<br/>more in policy than in malice, even so as one would<br/>beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious<br/>lion. Sue to him again and he’s yours.<br/>I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive<br/>so good a commander with so slight, so drunken,<br/>and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak<br/>parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse<br/>fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou<br/>invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be<br/>known by, let us call thee devil!<br/>What was he that you followed with your sword?<br/>What had he done to you?<br/>I know not.<br/>Is ’t possible?<br/>I remember a mass of things, but nothing<br/>distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O<br/>God, that men should put an enemy in their<br/>mouths to steal away their brains! That we should<br/>with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform<br/>ourselves into beasts!<br/>Why, but you are now well enough. How came<br/>you thus recovered?<br/>It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give<br/>place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows<br/>me another, to make me frankly despise myself.<br/>Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time,<br/>the place, and the condition of this country stands,<br/>I could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But<br/>since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.<br/>I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell<br/>me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as<br/>Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be<br/>now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently<br/>a beast! O, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed,<br/>and the ingredient is a devil.<br/>Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,<br/>if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it.<br/>And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.<br/>I have well approved it, sir.—I drunk!<br/>You or any man living may be drunk at a time,<br/>man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s<br/>wife is now the general: I may say so in this<br/>respect, for that he hath devoted and given up<br/>himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement<br/>of her parts and graces. Confess yourself<br/>freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your<br/>place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so<br/>blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her<br/>goodness not to do more than she is requested. This<br/>broken joint between you and her husband entreat<br/>her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay<br/>worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow<br/>stronger than it was before.<br/>You advise me well.<br/>I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest<br/>kindness.<br/>I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I<br/>will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake<br/>for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check<br/>me here.<br/>You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I<br/>must to the watch.<br/>Good night, honest Iago.<br/>And what’s he, then, that says I play the villain,<br/>When this advice is free I give and honest,<br/>Probal to thinking, and indeed the course<br/>To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy<br/>Th’ inclining Desdemona to subdue<br/>In any honest suit. She’s framed as fruitful<br/>As the free elements. And then for her<br/>To win the Moor—were ’t to renounce his baptism,<br/>All seals and symbols of redeemèd sin—<br/>His soul is so enfettered to her love<br/>That she may make, unmake, do what she list,<br/>Even as her appetite shall play the god<br/>With his weak function. How am I then a villain<br/>To counsel Cassio to this parallel course<br/>Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!<br/>When devils will the blackest sins put on,<br/>They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,<br/>As I do now. For whiles this honest fool<br/>Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,<br/>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,<br/>I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear:<br/>That she repeals him for her body’s lust;<br/>And by how much she strives to do him good,<br/>She shall undo her credit with the Moor.<br/>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,<br/>And out of her own goodness make the net<br/>That shall enmesh them all.<br/>How now, Roderigo?<br/>I do follow here in the chase, not like a<br/>hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My<br/>money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly<br/>well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I<br/>shall have so much experience for my pains, and so,<br/>with no money at all and a little more wit, return<br/>again to Venice.<br/>How poor are they that have not patience!<br/>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?<br/>Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,<br/>And wit depends on dilatory time.<br/>Does ’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,<br/>And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio.<br/>Though other things grow fair against the sun,<br/>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.<br/>Content thyself awhile. By th’ Mass, ’tis morning!<br/>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.<br/>Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.<br/>Away, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.<br/>Nay, get thee gone.<br/>Two things are to be done.<br/>My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.<br/>I’ll set her on.<br/>Myself the while to draw the Moor apart<br/>And bring him jump when he may Cassio find<br/>Soliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.<br/>Dull not device by coldness and delay.<br/>Masters, play here (I will content your pains)<br/>Something that’s brief; and bid Good morrow,<br/>general.<br/>Why masters, have your instruments been in<br/>Naples, that they speak i’ th’ nose thus?<br/>How, sir, how?<br/>Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?<br/>Ay, marry, are they, sir.<br/>O, thereby hangs a tail.<br/>Whereby hangs a tale, sir?<br/>Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I<br/>know. But, masters, here’s money for you; and the<br/>General so likes your music that he desires you, for<br/>love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.<br/>Well, sir, we will not.<br/>If you have any music that may not be heard, to<br/>’t again. But, as they say, to hear music the General<br/>does not greatly care.<br/>We have none such, sir.<br/>Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll<br/>away. Go, vanish into air, away!<br/>Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?<br/>No, I hear not your honest friend. I hear you.<br/>Prithee, keep up thy quillets.<br/>There’s a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman<br/>that attends the General’s wife be stirring,<br/>tell her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favor<br/>of speech. Wilt thou do this?<br/>She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall<br/>seem to notify unto her.<br/>Do, good my friend.<br/>In happy time, Iago.<br/>You have not been abed, then?<br/>Why, no. The day had broke<br/>Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,<br/>To send in to your wife. My suit to her<br/>Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona<br/>Procure me some access.<br/>I’ll send her to you presently,<br/>And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor<br/>Out of the way, that your converse and business<br/>May be more free.<br/>I humbly thank you for ’t. I never<br/>knew<br/>A Florentine more kind and honest.<br/>Good morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry<br/>For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.<br/>The General and his wife are talking of it,<br/>And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies<br/>That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus<br/>And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom<br/>He might not but refuse you. But he protests he<br/>loves you<br/>And needs no other suitor but his likings<br/>To take the safest occasion by the front<br/>To bring you in again.<br/>Yet I beseech you,<br/>If you think fit, or that it may be done,<br/>Give me advantage of some brief discourse<br/>With Desdemon alone.<br/>Pray you come in.<br/>I will bestow you where you shall have time<br/>To speak your bosom freely.<br/>I am much bound to you.<br/>These letters give, Iago, to the pilot<br/>And by him do my duties to the Senate.<br/>That done, I will be walking on the works.<br/>Repair there to me.<br/>Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.<br/>This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see ’t?<br/>We wait upon your Lordship.<br/>Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do<br/>All my abilities in thy behalf.<br/>Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband<br/>As if the cause were his.<br/>O, that’s an honest fellow! Do not doubt, Cassio,<br/>But I will have my lord and you again<br/>As friendly as you were.<br/>Bounteous madam,<br/>Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,<br/>He’s never anything but your true servant.<br/>I know ’t. I thank you. You do love my lord;<br/>You have known him long; and be you well assured<br/>He shall in strangeness stand no farther off<br/>Than in a politic distance.<br/>Ay, but, lady,<br/>That policy may either last so long,<br/>Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,<br/>Or breed itself so out of circumstance,<br/>That, I being absent and my place supplied,<br/>My general will forget my love and service.<br/>Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here,<br/>I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,<br/>If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it<br/>To the last article. My lord shall never rest:<br/>I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;<br/>His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;<br/>I’ll intermingle everything he does<br/>With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,<br/>For thy solicitor shall rather die<br/>Than give thy cause away.<br/>Madam, here comes my lord.<br/>Madam, I’ll take my leave.<br/>Why, stay, and hear me speak.<br/>Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,<br/>Unfit for mine own purposes.<br/>Well, do your discretion.<br/>Ha, I like not that.<br/>What dost thou say?<br/>Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.<br/>Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?<br/>Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it<br/>That he would steal away so guiltylike,<br/>Seeing your coming.<br/>I do believe ’twas he.<br/>How now, my lord?<br/>I have been talking with a suitor here,<br/>A man that languishes in your displeasure.<br/>Who is ’t you mean?<br/>Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,<br/>If I have any grace or power to move you,<br/>His present reconciliation take;<br/>For if he be not one that truly loves you,<br/>That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,<br/>I have no judgment in an honest face.<br/>I prithee call him back.<br/>Went he hence now?<br/>Yes, faith, so humbled<br/>That he hath left part of his grief with me<br/>To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.<br/>Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.<br/>But shall ’t be shortly?<br/>The sooner, sweet, for you.<br/>Shall ’t be tonight at supper?<br/>No, not tonight.<br/>Tomorrow dinner, then?<br/>I shall not dine at home;<br/>I meet the captains at the citadel.<br/>Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,<br/>On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn.<br/>I prithee name the time, but let it not<br/>Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;<br/>And yet his trespass, in our common reason—<br/>Save that, they say, the wars must make example<br/>Out of her best—is not almost a fault<br/>T’ incur a private check. When shall he come?<br/>Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul<br/>What you would ask me that I should deny,<br/>Or stand so mamm’ring on? What? Michael Cassio,<br/>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,<br/>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,<br/>Hath ta’en your part—to have so much to do<br/>To bring him in! By ’r Lady, I could do much—<br/>Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;<br/>I will deny thee nothing.<br/>Why, this is not a boon!<br/>’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,<br/>Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,<br/>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit<br/>To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit<br/>Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,<br/>It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,<br/>And fearful to be granted.<br/>I will deny thee nothing!<br/>Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,<br/>To leave me but a little to myself.<br/>Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.<br/>Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.<br/>Emilia, come.—Be as your fancies teach you.<br/>Whate’er you be, I am obedient.<br/>Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul<br/>But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,<br/>Chaos is come again.<br/>My noble lord—<br/>What dost thou say, Iago?<br/>Did Michael Cassio,<br/>When you wooed my lady, know of your love?<br/>He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?<br/>But for a satisfaction of my thought,<br/>No further harm.<br/>Why of thy thought, Iago?<br/>I did not think he had been acquainted with her.<br/>O yes, and went between us very oft.<br/>Indeed?<br/>Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou aught in that?<br/>Is he not honest?<br/>Honest, my lord?<br/>Honest—ay, honest.<br/>My lord, for aught I know.<br/>What dost thou think?<br/>Think, my lord?<br/>Think, my lord? By heaven, thou echo’st me<br/>As if there were some monster in thy thought<br/>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean<br/>something.<br/>I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,<br/>When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?<br/>And when I told thee he was of my counsel<br/>In my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st<br/>Indeed?<br/>And didst contract and purse thy brow together<br/>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain<br/>Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,<br/>Show me thy thought.<br/>My lord, you know I love you.<br/>I think thou dost;<br/>And for I know thou ’rt full of love and honesty<br/>And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them<br/>breath,<br/>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.<br/>For such things in a false, disloyal knave<br/>Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,<br/>They’re close dilations working from the heart<br/>That passion cannot rule.<br/>For Michael Cassio,<br/>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.<br/>I think so too.<br/>Men should be what they seem;<br/>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!<br/>Certain, men should be what they seem.<br/>Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.<br/>Nay, yet there’s more in this.<br/>I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,<br/>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of<br/>thoughts<br/>The worst of words.<br/>Good my lord, pardon me.<br/>Though I am bound to every act of duty,<br/>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.<br/>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and<br/>false—<br/>As where’s that palace whereinto foul things<br/>Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so<br/>pure<br/>But some uncleanly apprehensions<br/>Keep leets and law days and in sessions sit<br/>With meditations lawful?<br/>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,<br/>If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear<br/>A stranger to thy thoughts.<br/>I do beseech you,<br/>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess—<br/>As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague<br/>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy<br/>Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom<br/>From one that so imperfectly conceits<br/>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble<br/>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.<br/>It were not for your quiet nor your good,<br/>Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,<br/>To let you know my thoughts.<br/>What dost thou mean?<br/>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,<br/>Is the immediate jewel of their souls.<br/>Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something,<br/>nothing;<br/>’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to<br/>thousands.<br/>But he that filches from me my good name<br/>Robs me of that which not enriches him<br/>And makes me poor indeed.<br/>By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.<br/>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,<br/>Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.<br/>Ha?<br/>O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!<br/>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock<br/>The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss<br/>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;<br/>But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er<br/>Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!<br/>O misery!<br/>Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;<br/>But riches fineless is as poor as winter<br/>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.<br/>Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend<br/>From jealousy!<br/>Why, why is this?<br/>Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,<br/>To follow still the changes of the moon<br/>With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt<br/>Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat<br/>When I shall turn the business of my soul<br/>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,<br/>Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous<br/>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<br/>Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.<br/>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.<br/>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br/>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,<br/>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,<br/>I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br/>And on the proof, there is no more but this:<br/>Away at once with love or jealousy.<br/>I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason<br/>To show the love and duty that I bear you<br/>With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,<br/>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.<br/>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;<br/>Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.<br/>I would not have your free and noble nature,<br/>Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t.<br/>I know our country disposition well.<br/>In Venice they do let God see the pranks<br/>They dare not show their husbands. Their best<br/>conscience<br/>Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown.<br/>Dost thou say so?<br/>She did deceive her father, marrying you,<br/>And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,<br/>She loved them most.<br/>And so she did.<br/>Why, go to, then!<br/>She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,<br/>To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,<br/>He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to<br/>blame.<br/>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<br/>For too much loving you.<br/>I am bound to thee forever.<br/>I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.<br/>Not a jot, not a jot.<br/>I’ faith, I fear it has.<br/>I hope you will consider what is spoke<br/>Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved.<br/>I am to pray you not to strain my speech<br/>To grosser issues nor to larger reach<br/>Than to suspicion.<br/>I will not.<br/>Should you do so, my lord,<br/>My speech should fall into such vile success<br/>As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy<br/>friend.<br/>My lord, I see you’re moved.<br/>No, not much moved.<br/>I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.<br/>Long live she so! And long live you to think so!<br/>And yet, how nature erring from itself—<br/>Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,<br/>Not to affect many proposèd matches<br/>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,<br/>Whereto we see in all things nature tends—<br/>Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,<br/>Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural—<br/>But pardon me—I do not in position<br/>Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear<br/>Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,<br/>May fall to match you with her country forms<br/>And happily repent.<br/>Farewell, farewell!<br/>If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.<br/>Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.<br/>My lord, I take my leave.<br/>Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless<br/>Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.<br/>My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor<br/>To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.<br/>Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place—<br/>For sure he fills it up with great ability—<br/>Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,<br/>You shall by that perceive him and his means.<br/>Note if your lady strain his entertainment<br/>With any strong or vehement importunity.<br/>Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,<br/>Let me be thought too busy in my fears—<br/>As worthy cause I have to fear I am—<br/>And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.<br/>Fear not my government.<br/>I once more take my leave.<br/>This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,<br/>And knows all qualities with a learnèd spirit<br/>Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,<br/>Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,<br/>I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind<br/>To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black<br/>And have not those soft parts of conversation<br/>That chamberers have, or for I am declined<br/>Into the vale of years—yet that’s not much—<br/>She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief<br/>Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,<br/>That we can call these delicate creatures ours<br/>And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad<br/>And live upon the vapor of a dungeon<br/>Than keep a corner in the thing I love<br/>For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague of great ones;<br/>Prerogatived are they less than the base.<br/>’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.<br/>Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us<br/>When we do quicken. Look where she comes.<br/>If she be false, heaven mocks itself!<br/>I’ll not believe ’t.<br/>How now, my dear Othello?<br/>Your dinner, and the generous islanders<br/>By you invited, do attend your presence.<br/>I am to blame.<br/>Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well?<br/>I have a pain upon my forehead, here.<br/>Faith, that’s with watching. ’Twill away again.<br/>Let me but bind it hard; within this hour<br/>It will be well.<br/>Your napkin is too little.<br/>Let it alone.<br/>Come, I’ll go in with you.<br/>I am very sorry that you are not well.<br/>I am glad I have found this napkin.<br/>This was her first remembrance from the Moor.<br/>My wayward husband hath a hundred times<br/>Wooed me to steal it. But she so loves the token<br/>(For he conjured her she should ever keep it)<br/>That she reserves it evermore about her<br/>To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out<br/>And give ’t Iago. What he will do with it<br/>Heaven knows, not I.<br/>I nothing but to please his fantasy.<br/>How now? What do you here alone?<br/>Do not you chide. I have a thing for you.<br/>You have a thing for me? It is a common thing—<br/>Ha?<br/>To have a foolish wife.<br/>O, is that all? What will you give me now<br/>For that same handkerchief?<br/>What handkerchief?<br/>What handkerchief?<br/>Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,<br/>That which so often you did bid me steal.<br/>Hast stol’n it from her?<br/>No, faith, she let it drop by negligence,<br/>And to th’ advantage I, being here, took ’t up.<br/>Look, here ’tis.<br/>A good wench! Give it me.<br/>What will you do with ’t, that you have been so<br/>earnest<br/>To have me filch it?<br/>Why, what is that to you?<br/>If it be not for some purpose of import,<br/>Give ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad<br/>When she shall lack it.<br/>Be not acknown on ’t.<br/>I have use for it. Go, leave me.<br/>I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin<br/>And let him find it. Trifles light as air<br/>Are to the jealous confirmations strong<br/>As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.<br/>The Moor already changes with my poison;<br/>Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,<br/>Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,<br/>But with a little act upon the blood<br/>Burn like the mines of sulfur.<br/>I did say so.<br/>Look where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora<br/>Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world<br/>Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br/>Which thou owedst yesterday.<br/>Ha, ha, false to me?<br/>Why, how now, general? No more of that!<br/>Avaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.<br/>I swear ’tis better to be much abused<br/>Than but to know ’t a little.<br/>How now, my lord?<br/>What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?<br/>I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.<br/>I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and<br/>merry.<br/>I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.<br/>He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,<br/>Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.<br/>I am sorry to hear this.<br/>I had been happy if the general camp,<br/>Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,<br/>So I had nothing known. O, now, forever<br/>Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!<br/>Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars<br/>That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!<br/>Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,<br/>The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,<br/>The royal banner, and all quality,<br/>Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!<br/>And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats<br/>Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit,<br/>Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!<br/>Is ’t possible, my lord?<br/>Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!<br/>Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,<br/>Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,<br/>Thou hadst been better have been born a dog<br/>Than answer my waked wrath.<br/>Is ’t come to this?<br/>Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it<br/>That the probation bear no hinge nor loop<br/>To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!<br/>My noble lord—<br/>If thou dost slander her and torture me,<br/>Never pray more. Abandon all remorse;<br/>On horror’s head horrors accumulate;<br/>Do deeds to make heaven weep, all Earth amazed;<br/>For nothing canst thou to damnation add<br/>Greater than that.<br/>O grace! O heaven forgive me!<br/>Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?<br/>God b’ wi’ you. Take mine office.—O wretched fool,<br/>That liv’st to make thine honesty a vice!—<br/>O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world:<br/>To be direct and honest is not safe.—<br/>I thank you for this profit, and from hence<br/>I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.<br/>Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.<br/>I should be wise; for honesty’s a fool<br/>And loses that it works for.<br/>By the world,<br/>I think my wife be honest and think she is not.<br/>I think that thou art just and think thou art not.<br/>I’ll have some proof! Her name, that was as fresh<br/>As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black<br/>As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,<br/>Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,<br/>I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!<br/>I see you are eaten up with passion.<br/>I do repent me that I put it to you.<br/>You would be satisfied?<br/>Would? Nay, and I will.<br/>And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?<br/>Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,<br/>Behold her topped?<br/>Death and damnation! O!<br/>It were a tedious difficulty, I think,<br/>To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then<br/>If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster<br/>More than their own! What then? How then?<br/>What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?<br/>It is impossible you should see this,<br/>Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,<br/>As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross<br/>As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,<br/>If imputation and strong circumstances<br/>Which lead directly to the door of truth<br/>Will give you satisfaction, you might have ’t.<br/>Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.<br/>I do not like the office,<br/>But sith I am entered in this cause so far,<br/>Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love,<br/>I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,<br/>And being troubled with a raging tooth<br/>I could not sleep. There are a kind of men<br/>So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter<br/>Their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.<br/>In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona,<br/>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves.<br/>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,<br/>Cry O sweet creature! then kiss me hard,<br/>As if he plucked up kisses by the roots<br/>That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg<br/>O’er my thigh, and sighed, and kissed, and then<br/>Cried Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor!<br/>O monstrous! Monstrous!<br/>Nay, this was but his<br/>dream.<br/>But this denoted a foregone conclusion.<br/>’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.<br/>And this may help to thicken other proofs<br/>That do demonstrate thinly.<br/>I’ll tear her all to pieces.<br/>Nay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done.<br/>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:<br/>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief<br/>Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?<br/>I gave her such a one. ’Twas my first gift.<br/>I know not that; but such a handkerchief—<br/>I am sure it was your wife’s—did I today<br/>See Cassio wipe his beard with.<br/>If it be that—<br/>If it be that, or any that was hers,<br/>It speaks against her with the other proofs.<br/>O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!<br/>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.<br/>Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago,<br/>All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.<br/>’Tis gone.<br/>Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!<br/>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne<br/>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,<br/>For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!<br/>Yet be content.<br/>O, blood, blood, blood!<br/>Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.<br/>Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,<br/>Whose icy current and compulsive course<br/>Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on<br/>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,<br/>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace<br/>Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,<br/>Till that a capable and wide revenge<br/>Swallow them up. Now by yond marble<br/>heaven,<br/>In the due reverence of a sacred vow,<br/>I here engage my words.<br/>Do not rise yet.<br/>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,<br/>You elements that clip us round about,<br/>Witness that here Iago doth give up<br/>The execution of his wit, hands, heart<br/>To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command,<br/>And to obey shall be in me remorse,<br/>What bloody business ever.<br/>I greet thy love<br/>Not with vain thanks but with acceptance<br/>bounteous,<br/>And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.<br/>Within these three days let me hear thee say<br/>That Cassio’s not alive.<br/>My friend is dead.<br/>’Tis done at your request. But let her live.<br/>Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn<br/>her!<br/>Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw<br/>To furnish me with some swift means of death<br/>For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.<br/>I am your own forever.<br/>Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant<br/>Cassio lies?<br/>I dare not say he lies anywhere.<br/>Why, man?<br/>He’s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies,<br/>’tis stabbing.<br/>Go to! Where lodges he?<br/>To tell you where he lodges is to tell you<br/>where I lie.<br/>Can anything be made of this?<br/>I know not where he lodges; and for me to<br/>devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies<br/>there, were to lie in mine own throat.<br/>Can you inquire him out, and be edified<br/>by report?<br/>I will catechize the world for him—that is,<br/>make questions, and by them answer.<br/>Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I<br/>have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will<br/>be well.<br/>To do this is within the compass of man’s wit,<br/>and therefore I will attempt the doing it.<br/>Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?<br/>I know not, madam.<br/>Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse<br/>Full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor<br/>Is true of mind and made of no such baseness<br/>As jealous creatures are, it were enough<br/>To put him to ill thinking.<br/>Is he not jealous?<br/>Who, he? I think the sun where he was born<br/>Drew all such humors from him.<br/>Look where he<br/>comes.<br/>I will not leave him now till Cassio<br/>Be called to him.—How is ’t with you, my lord?<br/>Well, my good lady. O, hardness to<br/>dissemble!—<br/>How do you, Desdemona?<br/>Well, my good lord.<br/>Give me your hand. This hand<br/>is moist, my lady.<br/>It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.<br/>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.<br/>Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires<br/>A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,<br/>Much castigation, exercise devout;<br/>For here’s a young and sweating devil here<br/>That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,<br/>A frank one.<br/>You may indeed say so,<br/>For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.<br/>A liberal hand! The hearts of old gave hands,<br/>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.<br/>I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.<br/>What promise, chuck?<br/>I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.<br/>I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.<br/>Lend me thy handkerchief.<br/>Here, my lord.<br/>That which I gave you.<br/>I have it not about me.<br/>Not?<br/>No, faith, my lord.<br/>That’s a fault. That handkerchief<br/>Did an Egyptian to my mother give.<br/>She was a charmer, and could almost read<br/>The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept<br/>it,<br/>’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father<br/>Entirely to her love. But if she lost it,<br/>Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye<br/>Should hold her loathèd, and his spirits should hunt<br/>After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,<br/>And bid me, when my fate would have me wived,<br/>To give it her. I did so; and take heed on ’t,<br/>Make it a darling like your precious eye.<br/>To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition<br/>As nothing else could match.<br/>Is ’t possible?<br/>’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.<br/>A sybil that had numbered in the world<br/>The sun to course two hundred compasses,<br/>In her prophetic fury sewed the work.<br/>The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,<br/>And it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful<br/>Conserved of maidens’ hearts.<br/>I’ faith, is ’t true?<br/>Most veritable. Therefore, look to ’t well.<br/>Then would to God that I had never seen ’t!<br/>Ha? Wherefore?<br/>Why do you speak so startingly and rash?<br/>Is ’t lost? Is ’t gone? Speak, is ’t out o’ th’ way?<br/>Heaven bless us!<br/>Say you?<br/>It is not lost, but what an if it were?<br/>How?<br/>I say it is not lost.<br/>Fetch ’t. Let me see ’t!<br/>Why, so I can. But I will not now.<br/>This is a trick to put me from my suit.<br/>Pray you, let Cassio be received again.<br/>Fetch me the handkerchief! My mind<br/>misgives.<br/>Come, come.<br/>You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.<br/>The handkerchief!<br/>I pray, talk me of Cassio.<br/>The handkerchief!<br/>A man that all his time<br/>Hath founded his good fortunes on your love;<br/>Shared dangers with you—<br/>The handkerchief!<br/>I’ faith, you are to blame.<br/>Zounds!<br/>Is not this man jealous?<br/>I ne’er saw this before.<br/>Sure, there’s some wonder in this handkerchief!<br/>I am most unhappy in the loss of it.<br/>’Tis not a year or two shows us a man.<br/>They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;<br/>They eat us hungerly, and when they are full<br/>They belch us.<br/>Look you—Cassio and my husband.<br/>There is no other way; ’tis she must do ’t,<br/>And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.<br/>How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?<br/>Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you<br/>That by your virtuous means I may again<br/>Exist, and be a member of his love<br/>Whom I with all the office of my heart<br/>Entirely honor. I would not be delayed.<br/>If my offense be of such mortal kind<br/>That nor my service past nor present sorrows<br/>Nor purposed merit in futurity<br/>Can ransom me into his love again,<br/>But to know so must be my benefit.<br/>So shall I clothe me in a forced content,<br/>And shut myself up in some other course<br/>To fortune’s alms.<br/>Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,<br/>My advocation is not now in tune.<br/>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him<br/>Were he in favor as in humor altered.<br/>So help me every spirit sanctified<br/>As I have spoken for you all my best,<br/>And stood within the blank of his displeasure<br/>For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.<br/>What I can do I will; and more I will<br/>Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.<br/>Is my lord angry?<br/>He went hence but now,<br/>And certainly in strange unquietness.<br/>Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon<br/>When it hath blown his ranks into the air<br/>And, like the devil, from his very arm<br/>Puffed his own brother—and is he angry?<br/>Something of moment then. I will go meet him.<br/>There’s matter in ’t indeed if he be angry.<br/>I prithee do so.<br/>Something, sure, of state,<br/>Either from Venice, or some unhatched practice<br/>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,<br/>Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases<br/>Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,<br/>Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so.<br/>For let our finger ache, and it endues<br/>Our other healthful members even to a sense<br/>Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,<br/>Nor of them look for such observancy<br/>As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<br/>I was—unhandsome warrior as I am!—<br/>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul.<br/>But now I find I had suborned the witness,<br/>And he’s indicted falsely.<br/>Pray heaven it be<br/>State matters, as you think, and no conception<br/>Nor no jealous toy concerning you.<br/>Alas the day, I never gave him cause!<br/>But jealous souls will not be answered so.<br/>They are not ever jealous for the cause,<br/>But jealous for they’re jealous. It is a monster<br/>Begot upon itself, born on itself.<br/>Heaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind!<br/>Lady, amen.<br/>I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout.<br/>If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit<br/>And seek to effect it to my uttermost.<br/>I humbly thank your Ladyship.<br/>’Save you, friend Cassio!<br/>What make you from<br/>home?<br/>How is ’t with you, my most fair Bianca?<br/>I’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.<br/>And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.<br/>What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights,<br/>Eightscore eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours<br/>More tedious than the dial eightscore times?<br/>O weary reck’ning!<br/>Pardon me, Bianca.<br/>I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed,<br/>But I shall in a more continuate time<br/>Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,<br/>Take me this work out.<br/>O, Cassio, whence came this?<br/>This is some token from a newer friend.<br/>To the felt absence now I feel a cause.<br/>Is ’t come to this? Well, well.<br/>Go to, woman!<br/>Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,<br/>From whence you have them. You are jealous now<br/>That this is from some mistress, some<br/>remembrance.<br/>No, by my faith, Bianca.<br/>Why, whose is it?<br/>I know not neither. I found it in my chamber.<br/>I like the work well. Ere it be demanded,<br/>As like enough it will, I would have it copied.<br/>Take it, and do ’t, and leave me for this time.<br/>Leave you? Wherefore?<br/>I do attend here on the General,<br/>And think it no addition, nor my wish,<br/>To have him see me womaned.<br/>Why, I pray you?<br/>Not that I love you not.<br/>But that you do not love me!<br/>I pray you bring me on the way a little,<br/>And say if I shall see you soon at night.<br/>’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,<br/>For I attend here. But I’ll see you soon.<br/>’Tis very good. I must be circumstanced.<br/>Will you think so?<br/>Think so, Iago?<br/>What,<br/>To kiss in private?<br/>An unauthorized kiss!<br/>Or to be naked with her friend in bed<br/>An hour or more, not meaning any harm?<br/>Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?<br/>It is hypocrisy against the devil!<br/>They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,<br/>The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt<br/>heaven.<br/>If they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.<br/>But if I give my wife a handkerchief—<br/>What then?<br/>Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,<br/>She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.<br/>She is protectress of her honor, too.<br/>May she give that?<br/>Her honor is an essence that’s not seen;<br/>They have it very oft that have it not.<br/>But for the handkerchief—<br/>By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.<br/>Thou saidst—O, it comes o’er my memory<br/>As doth the raven o’er the infectious house,<br/>Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.<br/>Ay, what of that?<br/>That’s not so good now.<br/>What<br/>If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?<br/>Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,<br/>Who having, by their own importunate suit<br/>Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,<br/>Convincèd or supplied them, cannot choose<br/>But they must blab)—<br/>Hath he said anything?<br/>He hath, my lord, but be you well assured,<br/>No more than he’ll unswear.<br/>What hath he said?<br/>Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.<br/>What? What?<br/>Lie—<br/>With her?<br/>With her—on her—what you will.<br/>Lie with her? Lie on her? We say lie on her<br/>when they belie her. Lie with her—Zounds, that’s<br/>fulsome! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief.<br/>To confess and be hanged for his labor.<br/>First to be hanged and then to confess—I tremble<br/>at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing<br/>passion without some instruction. It is not<br/>words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and<br/>lips—is ’t possible? Confess—handkerchief—O,<br/>devil!<br/>Work on,<br/>My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are<br/>caught,<br/>And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,<br/>All guiltless, meet reproach.—What ho! My lord!<br/>My lord, I say. Othello!<br/>How now, Cassio?<br/>What’s the matter?<br/>My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy.<br/>This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.<br/>Rub him about the temples.<br/>No, forbear.<br/>The lethargy must have his quiet course.<br/>If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by<br/>Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.<br/>Do you withdraw yourself a little while.<br/>He will recover straight. When he is gone,<br/>I would on great occasion speak with you.<br/>How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?<br/>Dost thou mock me?<br/>I mock you not, by heaven!<br/>Would you would bear your fortune like a man!<br/>A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast.<br/>There’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,<br/>And many a civil monster.<br/>Did he confess it?<br/>Good sir, be a man!<br/>Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked<br/>May draw with you. There’s millions now alive<br/>That nightly lie in those unproper beds<br/>Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.<br/>O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,<br/>To lip a wanton in a secure couch<br/>And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,<br/>And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.<br/>O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.<br/>Stand you awhile apart.<br/>Confine yourself but in a patient list.<br/>Whilst you were here, o’erwhelmèd with your grief—<br/>A passion most unsuiting such a man—<br/>Cassio came hither. I shifted him away<br/>And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,<br/>Bade him anon return and here speak with me,<br/>The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,<br/>And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns<br/>That dwell in every region of his face.<br/>For I will make him tell the tale anew—<br/>Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<br/>He hath and is again to cope your wife.<br/>I say but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,<br/>Or I shall say you’re all in all in spleen,<br/>And nothing of a man.<br/>Dost thou hear, Iago,<br/>I will be found most cunning in my patience,<br/>But (dost thou hear?) most bloody.<br/>That’s not amiss.<br/>But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?<br/>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br/>A huswife that by selling her desires<br/>Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature<br/>That dotes on Cassio—as ’tis the strumpet’s plague<br/>To beguile many and be beguiled by one.<br/>He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain<br/>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.<br/>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,<br/>And his unbookish jealousy must construe<br/>Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviors<br/>Quite in the wrong.—How do you, lieutenant?<br/>The worser that you give me the addition<br/>Whose want even kills me.<br/>Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t.<br/>Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,<br/>How quickly should you speed!<br/>Alas, poor caitiff!<br/>Look how he laughs already!<br/>I never knew woman love man so.<br/>Alas, poor rogue, I think i’ faith she loves me.<br/>Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.<br/>Do you hear, Cassio?<br/>Now he importunes him<br/>To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.<br/>She gives it out that you shall marry her.<br/>Do you intend it?<br/>Ha, ha, ha!<br/>Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?<br/>I marry her? What, a customer? Prithee bear<br/>some charity to my wit! Do not think it so unwholesome.<br/>Ha, ha, ha!<br/>So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.<br/>Faith, the cry goes that you marry her.<br/>Prithee say true!<br/>I am a very villain else.<br/>Have you scored me? Well.<br/>This is the monkey’s own giving out. She is<br/>persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and<br/>flattery, not out of my promise.<br/>Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.<br/>She was here even now. She haunts me in<br/>every place. I was the other day talking on the<br/>sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes<br/>the bauble. By this hand, she falls thus about my<br/>neck!<br/>Crying, O dear Cassio, as it were; his<br/>gesture imports it.<br/>So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so<br/>shakes and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!<br/>Now he tells how she plucked him to my<br/>chamber.—O, I see that nose of yours, but not that<br/>dog I shall throw it to.<br/>Well, I must leave her company.<br/>Before me, look where she comes.<br/>’Tis such another fitchew—marry, a perfumed<br/>one!—What do you mean by this haunting<br/>of me?<br/>Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did<br/>you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me<br/>even now? I was a fine fool to take it! I must take<br/>out the work? A likely piece of work, that you<br/>should find it in your chamber and know not who<br/>left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must<br/>take out the work! There, give it your hobbyhorse.<br/>Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t.<br/>How now, my sweet Bianca? How now? How now?<br/>By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!<br/>If you’ll come to supper tonight you may. If<br/>you will not, come when you are next prepared<br/>for.<br/>After her, after her!<br/>Faith, I must. She’ll rail in the streets else.<br/>Will you sup there?<br/>Faith, I intend so.<br/>Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very<br/>fain speak with you.<br/>Prithee come. Will you?<br/>Go to; say no more.<br/>How shall I murder him,<br/>Iago?<br/>Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?<br/>O Iago!<br/>And did you see the handkerchief?<br/>Was that mine?<br/>Yours, by this hand! And to see how he prizes<br/>the foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and<br/>he hath giv’n it his whore.<br/>I would have him nine years a-killing! A fine<br/>woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!<br/>Nay, you must forget that.<br/>Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned<br/>tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned<br/>to stone. I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the<br/>world hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by<br/>an emperor’s side and command him tasks.<br/>Nay, that’s not your way.<br/>Hang her, I do but say what she is! So<br/>delicate with her needle, an admirable musician—<br/>O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!<br/>Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!<br/>She’s the worse for all this.<br/>O, a thousand, a thousand times!—And then<br/>of so gentle a condition!<br/>Ay, too gentle.<br/>Nay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it,<br/>Iago! O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!<br/>If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her<br/>patent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes<br/>near nobody.<br/>I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me?<br/>O, ’tis foul in her.<br/>With mine officer!<br/>That’s fouler.<br/>Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I’ll not<br/>expostulate with her lest her body and beauty<br/>unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.<br/>Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed,<br/>even the bed she hath contaminated.<br/>Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very<br/>good.<br/>And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You<br/>shall hear more by midnight.<br/>Excellent good.<br/>What trumpet is that same?<br/>I warrant something from Venice.<br/>’Tis Lodovico. This comes from the Duke.<br/>See, your wife’s with him.<br/>God save you, worthy general.<br/>With all my heart, sir.<br/>The Duke and the Senators of Venice greet you.<br/>I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.<br/>And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?<br/>I am very glad to see you, signior.<br/>Welcome to Cyprus.<br/>I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?<br/>Lives, sir.<br/>Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord<br/>An unkind breach, but you shall make all well.<br/>Are you sure of that?<br/>My lord?<br/>This fail you not to do, as you<br/>will—<br/>He did not call; he’s busy in the paper.<br/>Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?<br/>A most unhappy one. I would do much<br/>T’ atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.<br/>Fire and brimstone!<br/>My lord?<br/>Are you wise?<br/>What, is he angry?<br/>May be the letter moved him.<br/>For, as I think, they do command him home,<br/>Deputing Cassio in his government.<br/>By my troth, I am glad on ’t.<br/>Indeed?<br/>My lord?<br/>I am glad to see you mad.<br/>Why, sweet Othello!<br/>Devil!<br/>I have not deserved this.<br/>My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,<br/>Though I should swear I saw ’t. ’Tis very much.<br/>Make her amends. She weeps.<br/>O, devil, devil!<br/>If that the Earth could teem with woman’s tears,<br/>Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.<br/>Out of my sight!<br/>I will not stay to offend you.<br/>Truly an obedient lady.<br/>I do beseech your Lordship call her back.<br/>Mistress.<br/>My lord?<br/>What would you with her, sir?<br/>Who, I, my lord?<br/>Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.<br/>Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,<br/>And turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep.<br/>And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient.<br/>Very obedient.—Proceed you in your tears.—<br/>Concerning this, sir—O, well-painted passion!—<br/>I am commanded home.—Get you away.<br/>I’ll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate<br/>And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!<br/>Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight<br/>I do entreat that we may sup together.<br/>You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and<br/>monkeys!<br/>Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate<br/>Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature<br/>Whom passion could not shake, whose solid virtue<br/>The shot of accident nor dart of chance<br/>Could neither graze nor pierce?<br/>He is much<br/>changed.<br/>Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?<br/>He’s that he is. I may not breathe my censure<br/>What he might be. If what he might he is not,<br/>I would to heaven he were.<br/>What? Strike his wife?<br/>’Faith, that was not so well. Yet would I knew<br/>That stroke would prove the worst.<br/>Is it his use?<br/>Or did the letters work upon his blood<br/>And new-create this fault?<br/>Alas, alas!<br/>It is not honesty in me to speak<br/>What I have seen and known. You shall observe<br/>him,<br/>And his own courses will denote him so<br/>That I may save my speech. Do but go after<br/>And mark how he continues.<br/>I am sorry that I am deceived in him.<br/>You have seen nothing then?<br/>Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.<br/>Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.<br/>But then I saw no harm, and then I heard<br/>Each syllable that breath made up between them.<br/>What, did they never whisper?<br/>Never, my lord.<br/>Nor send you out o’ th’ way?<br/>Never.<br/>To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?<br/>Never, my lord.<br/>That’s strange.<br/>I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,<br/>Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other,<br/>Remove your thought. It doth abuse your bosom.<br/>If any wretch have put this in your head,<br/>Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse,<br/>For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,<br/>There’s no man happy. The purest of their wives<br/>Is foul as slander.<br/>Bid her come hither. Go.<br/>She says enough. Yet she’s a simple bawd<br/>That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,<br/>A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.<br/>And yet she’ll kneel and pray. I have seen her do ’t.<br/>My lord, what is your will?<br/>Pray you, chuck, come hither.<br/>What is your<br/>pleasure?<br/>Let me see your eyes. Look in my face.<br/>What horrible fancy’s this?<br/>Some of your function,<br/>mistress.<br/>Leave procreants alone, and shut the door.<br/>Cough, or cry hem, if anybody come.<br/>Your mystery, your mystery! Nay, dispatch.<br/>Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?<br/>I understand a fury in your words,<br/>But not the words.<br/>Why? What art thou?<br/>Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.<br/>Come, swear it. Damn thyself,<br/>Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves<br/>Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double<br/>damned.<br/>Swear thou art honest.<br/>Heaven doth truly know it.<br/>Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.<br/>To whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?<br/>Ah, Desdemon, away, away, away!<br/>Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?<br/>Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?<br/>If haply you my father do suspect<br/>An instrument of this your calling back,<br/>Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,<br/>I have lost him too.<br/>Had it pleased heaven<br/>To try me with affliction, had they rained<br/>All kind of sores and shames on my bare head,<br/>Steeped me in poverty to the very lips,<br/>Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,<br/>I should have found in some place of my soul<br/>A drop of patience. But alas, to make me<br/>A fixèd figure for the time of scorn<br/>To point his slow unmoving finger at—<br/>Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.<br/>But there where I have garnered up my heart,<br/>Where either I must live or bear no life,<br/>The fountain from the which my current runs<br/>Or else dries up—to be discarded thence,<br/>Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads<br/>To knot and gender in—turn thy complexion there,<br/>Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,<br/>Ay, there look grim as hell.<br/>I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.<br/>O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,<br/>That quicken even with blowing! O thou weed,<br/>Who art so lovely fair, and smell’st so sweet<br/>That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst<br/>ne’er been born!<br/>Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?<br/>Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,<br/>Made to write whore upon? What committed?<br/>Committed? O thou public commoner,<br/>I should make very forges of my cheeks<br/>That would to cinders burn up modesty,<br/>Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed?<br/>Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;<br/>The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets<br/>Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth<br/>And will not hear ’t. What committed?<br/>Impudent strumpet!<br/>By heaven, you do me wrong!<br/>Are not you a strumpet?<br/>No, as I am a Christian!<br/>If to preserve this vessel for my lord<br/>From any other foul unlawful touch<br/>Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.<br/>What, not a whore?<br/>No, as I shall be saved.<br/>Is ’t possible?<br/>O, heaven forgive us!<br/>I cry you mercy, then.<br/>I took you for that cunning whore of Venice<br/>That married with Othello.—You, mistress,<br/>That have the office opposite to Saint Peter<br/>And keeps the gate of hell—you, you, ay, you!<br/>We have done our course. There’s money for your<br/>pains.<br/>I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.<br/>Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?<br/>How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?<br/>Faith, half asleep.<br/>Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord?<br/>With who?<br/>Why, with my lord, madam.<br/>Who is thy lord?<br/>He that is yours, sweet lady.<br/>I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.<br/>I cannot weep, nor answers have I none<br/>But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight<br/>Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember.<br/>And call thy husband hither.<br/>Here’s a change indeed.<br/>’Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.<br/>How have I been behaved that he might stick<br/>The small’st opinion on my least misuse?<br/>What is your pleasure, madam? How is ’t with you?<br/>I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes<br/>Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.<br/>He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,<br/>I am a child to chiding.<br/>What is the matter, lady?<br/>Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,<br/>Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her<br/>As true hearts cannot bear.<br/>Am I that name, Iago?<br/>What name, fair<br/>lady?<br/>Such as she said my lord did say I was.<br/>He called her whore. A beggar in his drink<br/>Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.<br/>Why did he so?<br/>I do not know. I am sure I am none such.<br/>Do not weep, do not weep! Alas the day!<br/>Hath she forsook so many noble matches,<br/>Her father and her country and her friends,<br/>To be called whore? Would it not make one<br/>weep?<br/>It is my wretched fortune.<br/>Beshrew him for ’t! How comes this trick upon him?<br/>Nay, heaven doth know.<br/>I will be hanged if some eternal villain,<br/>Some busy and insinuating rogue,<br/>Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,<br/>Have not devised this slander. I will be hanged else.<br/>Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.<br/>If any such there be, heaven pardon him.<br/>A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!<br/>Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her<br/>company?<br/>What place? What time? What form? What<br/>likelihood?<br/>The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,<br/>Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.<br/>O heaven, that such companions thou ’dst unfold,<br/>And put in every honest hand a whip<br/>To lash the rascals naked through the world,<br/>Even from the east to th’ west!<br/>Speak within door.<br/>O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was<br/>That turned your wit the seamy side without<br/>And made you to suspect me with the Moor.<br/>You are a fool. Go to!<br/>Alas, Iago,<br/>What shall I do to win my lord again?<br/>Good friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,<br/>I know not how I lost him. Here I<br/>kneel.<br/>If e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love,<br/>Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,<br/>Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense<br/>Delighted them in any other form,<br/>Or that I do not yet, and ever did,<br/>And ever will—though he do shake me off<br/>To beggarly divorcement—love him dearly,<br/>Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may<br/>do much,<br/>And his unkindness may defeat my life,<br/>But never taint my love. I cannot say whore—<br/>It does abhor me now I speak the word.<br/>To do the act that might the addition earn,<br/>Not the world’s mass of vanity could make me.<br/>I pray you be content. ’Tis but his humor.<br/>The business of the state does him offense,<br/>And he does chide with you.<br/>If ’twere no other—<br/>It is but so, I warrant.<br/>Hark how these instruments summon to supper.<br/>The messengers of Venice stays the meat.<br/>Go in and weep not. All things shall be well.<br/>How now, Roderigo?<br/>I do not find<br/>That thou deal’st justly with me.<br/>What in the contrary?<br/>Every day thou daff’st me with some device,<br/>Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now,<br/>keep’st from me all conveniency than suppliest me<br/>with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no<br/>longer endure it. Nor am I yet persuaded to put up<br/>in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.<br/>Will you hear me, Roderigo?<br/>Faith, I have heard too much, and your<br/>words and performances are no kin together.<br/>You charge me most unjustly.<br/>With naught but truth. I have wasted myself<br/>out of my means. The jewels you have had<br/>from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have<br/>corrupted a votaress. You have told me she hath<br/>received them, and returned me expectations and<br/>comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I<br/>find none.<br/>Well, go to! Very well.<br/>Very well. Go to! I cannot go to, man,<br/>nor ’tis not very well! By this hand, I say ’tis very<br/>scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.<br/>Very well.<br/>I tell you ’tis not very well! I will make<br/>myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me<br/>my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my<br/>unlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will<br/>seek satisfaction of you.<br/>You have said now.<br/>Ay, and said nothing but what I protest<br/>intendment of doing.<br/>Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even<br/>from this instant do build on thee a better opinion<br/>than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo.<br/>Thou hast taken against me a most just exception,<br/>but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy<br/>affair.<br/>It hath not appeared.<br/>I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your<br/>suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,<br/>Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed which I<br/>have greater reason to believe now than ever—I<br/>mean purpose, courage, and valor—this night show<br/>it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,<br/>take me from this world with treachery and<br/>devise engines for my life.<br/>Well, what is it? Is it within reason and<br/>compass?<br/>Sir, there is especial commission come from<br/>Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.<br/>Is that true? Why, then, Othello and Desdemona<br/>return again to Venice.<br/>O, no. He goes into Mauritania and takes away<br/>with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be<br/>lingered here by some accident—wherein none<br/>can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.<br/>How do you mean, removing him?<br/>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s<br/>place: knocking out his brains.<br/>And that you would have me to do?<br/>Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He<br/>sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to<br/>him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If<br/>you will watch his going thence (which I will<br/>fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may<br/>take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second<br/>your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come,<br/>stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will<br/>show you such a necessity in his death that you shall<br/>think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high<br/>supper time, and the night grows to waste. About it!<br/>I will hear further reason for this.<br/>And you shall be satisfied.<br/>I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.<br/>O, pardon me, ’twill do me good to walk.<br/>Madam, good night. I humbly thank your Ladyship.<br/>Your Honor is most welcome.<br/>Will you walk, sir?—O, Desdemona—<br/>My lord?<br/>Get you to bed on th’ instant. I will be<br/>returned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there.<br/>Look ’t be done.<br/>I will, my lord.<br/>How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.<br/>He says he will return incontinent,<br/>And hath commanded me to go to bed,<br/>And bade me to dismiss you.<br/>Dismiss me?<br/>It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia,<br/>Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.<br/>We must not now displease him.<br/>I would you had never seen him.<br/>So would not I. My love doth so approve him<br/>That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns—<br/>Prithee, unpin me—have grace and favor in them.<br/>I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.<br/>All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!<br/>If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me<br/>In one of those same sheets.<br/>Come, come, you talk!<br/>My mother had a maid called Barbary.<br/>She was in love, and he she loved proved mad<br/>And did forsake her. She had a song of willow,<br/>An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune,<br/>And she died singing it. That song tonight<br/>Will not go from my mind. I have much to do<br/>But to go hang my head all at one side<br/>And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.<br/>Shall I go fetch your nightgown?<br/>No, unpin me here.<br/>This Lodovico is a proper man.<br/>A very handsome man.<br/>He speaks well.<br/>I know a lady in Venice would have walked<br/>barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.<br/>The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,<br/>Sing all a green willow.<br/>Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,<br/>Sing willow, willow, willow.<br/>The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her<br/>moans,<br/>Sing willow, willow, willow;<br/>Her salt tears fell from her, and softened the<br/>stones—<br/>Lay by these.<br/>Sing willow, willow, willow.<br/>Prithee hie thee! He’ll come anon.<br/>Sing all a green willow must be my garland.<br/>Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve.<br/>Nay, that’s not next. Hark, who is ’t that knocks?<br/>It’s the wind.<br/>I called my love false love, but what said he then?<br/>Sing willow, willow, willow.<br/>If I court more women, you’ll couch with more<br/>men.—<br/>So, get thee gone. Good night. Mine eyes do itch;<br/>Doth that bode weeping?<br/>’Tis neither here nor there.<br/>I have heard it said so. O these men, these men!<br/>Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia—<br/>That there be women do abuse their husbands<br/>In such gross kind?<br/>There be some such, no<br/>question.<br/>Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?<br/>Why, would not you?<br/>No, by this heavenly light!<br/>Nor I neither, by this heavenly light.<br/>I might do ’t as well i’ th’ dark.<br/>Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?<br/>The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price<br/>for a small vice.<br/>In troth, I think thou wouldst not.<br/>In troth, I think I should, and undo ’t when I<br/>had done it. Marry, I would not do such a thing for<br/>a joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for<br/>gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition.<br/>But for the whole world—’Uds pity! Who<br/>would not make her husband a cuckold to make<br/>him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for ’t.<br/>Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong<br/>for the whole world!<br/>Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ th’ world;<br/>and, having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in<br/>your own world, and you might quickly make it<br/>right.<br/>I do not think there is any such woman.<br/>Yes, a dozen; and as many to th’ vantage as<br/>would store the world they played for.<br/>But I do think it is their husbands’ faults<br/>If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,<br/>And pour our treasures into foreign laps;<br/>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br/>Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,<br/>Or scant our former having in despite.<br/>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,<br/>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br/>Their wives have sense like them. They see, and<br/>smell,<br/>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br/>As husbands have. What is it that they do<br/>When they change us for others? Is it sport?<br/>I think it is. And doth affection breed it?<br/>I think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs?<br/>It is so too. And have not we affections,<br/>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br/>Then let them use us well. Else let them know,<br/>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.<br/>Good night, good night. God me such uses send,<br/>Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend.<br/>Here, stand behind this bulk. Straight will he<br/>come.<br/>Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.<br/>Quick, quick! Fear nothing. I’ll be at thy elbow.<br/>It makes us or it mars us—think on that,<br/>And fix most firm thy resolution.<br/>Be near at hand. I may miscarry in ’t.<br/>Here, at thy hand. Be bold and take thy stand.<br/>I have no great devotion to the deed,<br/>And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.<br/>’Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword! He dies.<br/>I have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense,<br/>And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,<br/>Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,<br/>Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,<br/>He calls me to a restitution large<br/>Of gold and jewels that I bobbed from him<br/>As gifts to Desdemona.<br/>It must not be. If Cassio do remain,<br/>He hath a daily beauty in his life<br/>That makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor<br/>May unfold me to him. There stand I in much peril.<br/>No, he must die. Be ’t so. I hear him coming.<br/>I know his gait. ’Tis he!—Villain, thou diest!<br/>That thrust had been mine enemy indeed<br/>But that my coat is better than thou know’st.<br/>I will make proof of thine.<br/>O, I am slain!<br/>I am maimed forever! Help, ho! Murder, murder!<br/>The voice of Cassio! Iago keeps his word.<br/>O, villain that I am!<br/>It is even so.<br/>O, help ho! Light! A surgeon!<br/>’Tis he! O brave Iago, honest and just,<br/>That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!<br/>Thou teachest me.—Minion, your dear lies dead,<br/>And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come.<br/>Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are<br/>blotted.<br/>Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust’s blood be<br/>spotted.<br/>What ho! No watch? No passage? Murder, murder!<br/>’Tis some mischance. The voice is very direful.<br/>O, help!<br/>Hark!<br/>O wretched villain!<br/>Two or three groan. ’Tis heavy night.<br/>These may be counterfeits. Let’s think ’t unsafe<br/>To come in to the cry without more help.<br/>Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.<br/>Hark!<br/>Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and<br/>weapons.<br/>Who’s there? Whose noise is this that cries on<br/>murder?<br/>We do not know.<br/>Did not you hear a cry?<br/>Here, here! For heaven’s sake, help me!<br/>What’s the matter?<br/>This is Othello’s ancient, as I take it.<br/>The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.<br/>What are you here that cry so grievously?<br/>Iago? O, I am spoiled, undone by villains.<br/>Give me some help!<br/>O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?<br/>I think that one of them is hereabout<br/>And cannot make away.<br/>O treacherous villains!<br/>What are you there?<br/>Come in, and give some help.<br/>O, help me here!<br/>That’s one of them.<br/>O murd’rous slave! O villain!<br/>O damned Iago! O inhuman dog!<br/>Kill men i’ th’ dark?—Where be these bloody<br/>thieves?<br/>How silent is this town! Ho, murder, murder!—<br/>What may you be? Are you of good or evil?<br/>As you shall prove us, praise us.<br/>Signior Lodovico?<br/>He, sir.<br/>I cry you mercy. Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.<br/>Cassio?<br/>How is ’t, brother?<br/>My leg is cut in two.<br/>Marry, heaven forbid!<br/>Light, gentlemen. I’ll bind it with my shirt.<br/>What is the matter, ho? Who is ’t that cried?<br/>Who is ’t that cried?<br/>O, my dear Cassio,<br/>My sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!<br/>O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect<br/>Who they should be that have thus mangled you?<br/>No.<br/>I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.<br/>Lend me a garter. So.—O for a chair<br/>To bear him easily hence!<br/>Alas, he faints. O, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!<br/>Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash<br/>To be a party in this injury.—<br/>Patience awhile, good Cassio.—Come, come;<br/>Lend me a light. Know we this<br/>face or no?<br/>Alas, my friend and my dear countryman<br/>Roderigo? No! Yes, sure. O heaven, Roderigo!<br/>What, of Venice?<br/>Even he, sir. Did you know him?<br/>Know him? Ay.<br/>Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon.<br/>These bloody accidents must excuse my manners<br/>That so neglected you.<br/>I am glad to see you.<br/>How do you, Cassio?—O, a chair, a chair!<br/>Roderigo?<br/>He, he, ’tis he! O, that’s well<br/>said; the chair.—<br/>Some good man bear him carefully from hence.<br/>I’ll fetch the General’s surgeon.— For you, mistress,<br/>Save you your labor.—He that lies slain here,<br/>Cassio,<br/>Was my dear friend. What malice was between you?<br/>None in the world. Nor do I know the man.<br/>What, look you pale?—O, bear him out o’ th’ air.<br/>Stay you, good<br/>gentlemen.—Look you pale, mistress?—<br/>Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?—<br/>Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.—<br/>Behold her well. I pray you, look upon her.<br/>Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak<br/>Though tongues were out of use.<br/>Alas, what is the matter? What is the matter,<br/>husband?<br/>Cassio hath here been set on in the dark<br/>By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped.<br/>He’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.<br/>Alas, good gentleman! Alas, good Cassio!<br/>This is the fruits of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,<br/>Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight.<br/>What, do you shake at that?<br/>He supped at my house, but I therefore shake not.<br/>O, did he so? I charge you go with me.<br/>O fie upon thee, strumpet!<br/>I am no strumpet, but of life as honest<br/>As you that thus abuse me.<br/>As I? Faugh! Fie upon thee!<br/>Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dressed.—<br/>Come, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale.—<br/>Emilia, run you to the citadel<br/>And tell my lord and lady what hath happed.—<br/>Will you go on afore? This is the night<br/>That either makes me or fordoes me quite.<br/>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.<br/>Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars.<br/>It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,<br/>Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,<br/>And smooth as monumental alabaster.<br/>Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.<br/>Put out the light, and then put out the light.<br/>If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,<br/>I can again thy former light restore<br/>Should I repent me. But once put out thy light,<br/>Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,<br/>I know not where is that Promethean heat<br/>That can thy light relume. When I have plucked the<br/>rose,<br/>I cannot give it vital growth again.<br/>It needs must wither. I’ll smell it on the tree.<br/>O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade<br/>Justice to break her sword! One<br/>more, one more.<br/>Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee<br/>And love thee after. One more, and this the last.<br/>So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep,<br/>But they are cruel tears. This sorrow’s heavenly:<br/>It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.<br/>Who’s there? Othello?<br/>Ay, Desdemona.<br/>Will you come to bed, my lord?<br/>Have you prayed tonight, Desdemon?<br/>Ay, my lord.<br/>If you bethink yourself of any crime<br/>Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,<br/>Solicit for it straight.<br/>Alack, my lord,<br/>What may you mean by that?<br/>Well, do it, and be brief. I will walk by.<br/>I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit.<br/>No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.<br/>Talk you of killing?<br/>Ay, I do.<br/>Then heaven have mercy on me.<br/>Amen, with all my heart.<br/>If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.<br/>Humh.<br/>And yet I fear you, for you’re fatal then<br/>When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know<br/>not,<br/>Since guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.<br/>Think on thy sins.<br/>They are loves I bear to you.<br/>Ay, and for that thou diest.<br/>That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.<br/>Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?<br/>Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.<br/>These are portents, but yet I hope, I hope<br/>They do not point on me.<br/>Peace, and be still.<br/>I will so. What’s the matter?<br/>That handkerchief<br/>Which I so loved, and gave thee, thou gav’st to<br/>Cassio.<br/>No, by my life and soul! Send for the man<br/>And ask him.<br/>Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury.<br/>Thou art on thy deathbed.<br/>Ay, but not yet to die.<br/>Yes, presently.<br/>Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin.<br/>For to deny each article with oath<br/>Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception<br/>That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.<br/>Then Lord have mercy on me!<br/>I say Amen.<br/>And have you mercy, too. I never did<br/>Offend you in my life, never loved Cassio<br/>But with such general warranty of heaven<br/>As I might love. I never gave him token.<br/>By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand!<br/>O perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart<br/>And mak’st me call what I intend to do<br/>A murder, which I thought a sacrifice!<br/>I saw the handkerchief!<br/>He found it, then.<br/>I never gave it him. Send for him hither.<br/>Let him confess a truth.<br/>He hath confessed.<br/>What, my lord?<br/>That he hath used thee.<br/>How? Unlawfully?<br/>Ay.<br/>He will not say so.<br/>No. His mouth is stopped.<br/>Honest Iago hath ta’en order for ’t.<br/>O, my fear interprets. What, is he dead?<br/>Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge<br/>Had stomach for them all.<br/>Alas, he is betrayed, and I undone.<br/>Out, strumpet! Weep’st thou for him to my face?<br/>O banish me, my lord, but kill me not!<br/>Down, strumpet!<br/>Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight.<br/>Nay, if you strive—<br/>But half an hour!<br/>Being done, there is no pause.<br/>But while I say one prayer!<br/>It is too late.<br/>My lord, my lord? What ho! My lord, my lord!<br/>What noise is this?—Not dead? Not yet quite dead?<br/>I that am cruel am yet merciful.<br/>I would not have thee linger in thy pain.<br/>So, so.<br/>What, ho! My lord, my lord!<br/>Who’s<br/>there?<br/>O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you.<br/>Yes. ’Tis Emilia.—By and by.—She’s dead.<br/>’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death.<br/>The noise was here. Ha, no more moving?<br/>Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were ’t good?<br/>I think she stirs again. No. What’s best to do?<br/>If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.<br/>My wife, my wife! What wife? I have no wife.<br/>O insupportable! O heavy hour!<br/>Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse<br/>Of sun and moon, and that th’ affrighted globe<br/>Should yawn at alteration.<br/>I do beseech you<br/>That I may speak with you. O, good my lord—<br/>I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.—<br/>Soft, by and by, let me the curtains draw.—<br/>Where art thou?<br/>What’s the matter with thee now?<br/>O, my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done.<br/>What? Now?<br/>But now, my lord.<br/>It is the very error of the moon.<br/>She comes more nearer Earth than she was wont<br/>And makes men mad.<br/>Cassio, my lord, hath killed<br/>A young Venetian called Roderigo.<br/>Roderigo killed? And Cassio killed?<br/>No, Cassio is not killed.<br/>Not Cassio killed? Then murder’s out of tune,<br/>And sweet revenge grows harsh.<br/>O falsely, falsely murdered.<br/>O Lord, what cry is that?<br/>That? What?<br/>Out, and alas, that was my lady’s voice!<br/>Help! Help ho! Help! O lady, speak again!<br/>Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!<br/>A guiltless death I die.<br/>O, who hath done this deed?<br/>Nobody. I myself. Farewell.<br/>Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell.<br/>Why, how should she be murdered?<br/>Alas, who<br/>knows?<br/>You heard her say herself, it was not I.<br/>She said so. I must needs report the truth.<br/>She’s like a liar gone to burning hell!<br/>’Twas I that killed her.<br/>O, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!<br/>She turned to folly, and she was a whore.<br/>Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil!<br/>She was false as water.<br/>Thou art rash as fire to say<br/>That she was false. O, she was heavenly true!<br/>Cassio did top her. Ask thy husband else.<br/>O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell<br/>But that I did proceed upon just grounds<br/>To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.<br/>My husband?<br/>Thy husband.<br/>That she was false to wedlock?<br/>Ay, with Cassio. Had she been true,<br/>If heaven would make me such another world<br/>Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,<br/>I’d not have sold her for it.<br/>My husband?<br/>Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.<br/>An honest man he is, and hates the slime<br/>That sticks on filthy deeds.<br/>My husband?<br/>What needs this iterance, woman? I say, thy<br/>husband.<br/>O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!—<br/>My husband say she was false?<br/>He, woman.<br/>I say thy husband. Dost understand the word?<br/>My friend, thy husband; honest, honest Iago.<br/>If he say so, may his pernicious soul<br/>Rot half a grain a day! He lies to th’ heart!<br/>She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.<br/>Hah?<br/>Do thy worst!<br/>This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven<br/>Than thou wast worthy her.<br/>Peace, you were best!<br/>Thou hast not half that power to do me harm<br/>As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt,<br/>As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed—<br/>I care not for thy sword. I’ll make thee known,<br/>Though I lost twenty lives. Help! Help, ho! Help!<br/>The Moor hath killed my mistress! Murder, murder!<br/>What is the matter? How now, general?<br/>O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,<br/>That men must lay their murders on your neck.<br/>What is the matter?<br/>Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man.<br/>He says thou told’st him that his wife was false.<br/>I know thou didst not. Thou ’rt not such a villain.<br/>Speak, for my heart is full.<br/>I told him what I thought, and told no more<br/>Than what he found himself was apt and true.<br/>But did you ever tell him she was false?<br/>I did.<br/>You told a lie, an odious, damnèd lie!<br/>Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!<br/>She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?<br/>With Cassio, mistress. Go to! Charm your tongue.<br/>I will not charm my tongue. I am bound to speak.<br/>My mistress here lies murdered in her bed.<br/>O heavens forfend!<br/>And your reports have set the murder on!<br/>Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.<br/>’Tis a strange truth.<br/>O monstrous act!<br/>Villainy, villainy, villainy!<br/>I think upon ’t, I think! I smell ’t! O villainy!<br/>I thought so then. I’ll kill myself for grief!<br/>O villainy! Villainy!<br/>What, are you mad? I charge you get you home.<br/>Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.<br/>’Tis proper I obey him, but not now.<br/>Perchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.<br/>O, O, O!<br/>Nay, lay thee down, and roar!<br/>For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent<br/>That e’er did lift up eye.<br/>O, she was foul!—<br/>I scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece,<br/>Whose breath indeed these hands have newly<br/>stopped.<br/>I know this act shows horrible and grim.<br/>Poor Desdemon, I am glad thy father’s dead.<br/>Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief<br/>Shore his old thread in twain. Did he live now,<br/>This sight would make him do a desperate turn,<br/>Yea, curse his better angel from his side,<br/>And fall to reprobance.<br/>’Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows<br/>That she with Cassio hath the act of shame<br/>A thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it,<br/>And she did gratify his amorous works<br/>With that recognizance and pledge of love<br/>Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand.<br/>It was a handkerchief, an antique token<br/>My father gave my mother.<br/>O God! O heavenly God!<br/>Zounds, hold your peace!<br/>’Twill out, ’twill out. I peace?<br/>No, I will speak as liberal as the north.<br/>Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,<br/>All, all, cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.<br/>Be wise, and get you home.<br/>I will not.<br/>Fie, your sword upon a woman!<br/>O thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st<br/>of<br/>I found by fortune, and did give my husband—<br/>For often, with a solemn earnestness<br/>(More than indeed belonged to such a trifle),<br/>He begged of me to steal ’t.<br/>Villainous whore!<br/>She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,<br/>And I did give ’t my husband.<br/>Filth, thou liest!<br/>By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen!<br/>O murd’rous coxcomb, what should<br/>such a fool<br/>Do with so good a wife?<br/>Are there no stones in heaven<br/>But what serves for the thunder?—Precious villain!<br/>The woman falls! Sure he hath killed his wife.<br/>Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress’ side.<br/>He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.<br/>’Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon<br/>Which I have here recovered from the Moor.<br/>Come, guard the door without. Let him not pass,<br/>But kill him rather. I’ll after that same villain,<br/>For ’tis a damnèd slave.<br/>I am not valiant neither,<br/>But every puny whipster gets my sword.<br/>But why should honor outlive honesty?<br/>Let it go all.<br/>What did thy song bode, lady?<br/>Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan<br/>And die in music.<br/>Willow, willow, willow.<br/>Moor, she was chaste. She loved thee, cruel Moor.<br/>So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true.<br/>So speaking as I think, alas, I die. <br/>I have another weapon in this chamber.<br/>It is a sword of Spain, the ice brook’s temper.<br/>O, here it is.—Uncle, I must come forth.<br/>If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;<br/>Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer.<br/>Look in upon me, then, and speak with me,<br/>Or naked as I am I will assault thee.<br/>What is the matter?<br/>Behold, I have a weapon.<br/>A better never did itself sustain<br/>Upon a soldier’s thigh. I have seen the day<br/>That with this little arm and this good sword<br/>I have made my way through more impediments<br/>Than twenty times your stop. But—O vain boast!—<br/>Who can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.<br/>Be not afraid, though you do see me weaponed.<br/>Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt<br/>And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.<br/>Do you go back dismayed? ’Tis a lost fear.<br/>Man but a rush against Othello’s breast,<br/>And he retires. Where should Othello go?<br/>Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starred wench,<br/>Pale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,<br/>This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,<br/>And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?<br/>Even like thy chastity.—O cursèd, cursèd slave!—<br/>Whip me, you devils,<br/>From the possession of this heavenly sight!<br/>Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur,<br/>Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!<br/>O Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead! O, O!<br/>Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?<br/>That’s he that was Othello. Here I am.<br/>Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.<br/>I look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.—<br/>If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.<br/>Wrench his sword from him.<br/>I bleed, sir, but not killed.<br/>I am not sorry neither. I’d have thee live,<br/>For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.<br/>O thou Othello, that wert once so good,<br/>Fall’n in the practice of a damnèd slave,<br/>What shall be said to thee?<br/>Why, anything.<br/>An honorable murderer, if you will,<br/>For naught I did in hate, but all in honor.<br/>This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.<br/>Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?<br/>Ay.<br/>Dear general, I never gave you cause.<br/>I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.<br/>Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil<br/>Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?<br/>Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.<br/>From this time forth I never will speak word.<br/>What? Not to pray?<br/>Torments will ope your lips.<br/>Well, thou dost best.<br/>Sir,<br/>You shall understand what hath befall’n,<br/>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter<br/>Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,<br/>And here another. The one of<br/>them imports<br/>The death of Cassio, to be undertook<br/>By Roderigo.<br/>O villain!<br/>Most heathenish and most gross.<br/>Now here’s another discontented paper<br/>Found in his pocket, too; and this it seems<br/>Roderigo meant t’ have sent this damnèd villain,<br/>But that, belike, Iago in the interim<br/>Came in and satisfied him.<br/>O, thou pernicious caitiff!—<br/>How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief<br/>That was my wife’s?<br/>I found it in my chamber.<br/>And he himself confessed it but even now,<br/>That there he dropped it for a special purpose<br/>Which wrought to his desire.<br/>O fool, fool, fool!<br/>There is besides, in Roderigo’s letter,<br/>How he upbraids Iago, that he made him<br/>Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came<br/>That I was cast. And even but now he spake,<br/>After long seeming dead: Iago hurt him,<br/>Iago set him on.<br/>You must forsake this room and go with us.<br/>Your power and your command is taken off,<br/>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,<br/>If there be any cunning cruelty<br/>That can torment him much and hold him long,<br/>It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,<br/>Till that the nature of your fault be known<br/>To the Venetian state.—Come, bring away.<br/>Soft you. A word or two before you go.<br/>I have done the state some service, and they<br/>know ’t.<br/>No more of that. I pray you in your letters,<br/>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br/>Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,<br/>Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak<br/>Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;<br/>Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,<br/>Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br/>Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away<br/>Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued<br/>eyes,<br/>Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br/>Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br/>Their medicinable gum. Set you down this.<br/>And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br/>Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk<br/>Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,<br/>I took by th’ throat the circumcisèd dog,<br/>And smote him, thus.<br/>O bloody period!<br/>All that is spoke is marred.<br/>I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this,<br/>Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.<br/>This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,<br/>For he was great of heart.<br/>O Spartan dog,<br/>More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,<br/>Look on the tragic loading of this bed.<br/>This is thy work.—The object poisons sight.<br/>Let it be hid.—Gratiano, keep the house,<br/>And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,<br/>For they succeed on you. To you, lord<br/>governor,<br/>Remains the censure of this hellish villain.<br/>The time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it.<br/>Myself will straight aboard, and to the state<br/>This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
